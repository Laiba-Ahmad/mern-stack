    <h1 #top>Veggie burger</h1>
    <p>A veggie burger is a hamburger patty that does not contain meat. It can also be referred to the entire burger,
        including other fillings and buns. It may be made from ingredients like beans, especially soybeans and tofu,
        nuts, grains, seeds or fungi such as mushrooms or mycoprotein.</p>

    <p> The patties that are the essence of a veggie burger have existed in various Eurasian cuisines for millennia,
        including in the form of disc-shaped grilled or fried meatballs or as koftas, a commonplace item in Indian
        cuisine. These may contain meats or be made of entirely vegetarian ingredients such as legumes or other
        plant-derived proteins.</p>

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>There have been numerous claims of invention of the veggie burger. The dish, by name, may have been created in
        London in 1982 by Gregory Sams, who called it the 'VegeBurger'. Sams and his brother Craig had run a natural
        food restaurant in Paddington since the 1960s; a Carrefour hypermarket in Southampton sold 2000 packets in
        three weeks after its launch. An earlier reference can be heard in the 7 June 1948 episode of the American
        radio drama series Let George Do It called "The Mister Mirch Case" where a character refers to "vegeburgers" as
        a burger made of nuts and legumes.</p>

    <p> Using the name Gardenburger, an early veggie burger was developed by Paul Wenner around 1980 or 1981 in Wenner's
        vegetarian restaurant, The Gardenhouse, in Gresham, Oregon.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients purpose</h2>
    <h3>Grains</h3>
    <P>Grains are primarily used in the manufacturing of veggie burgers to act as a meat substitute. The grains, such as
        rice and wheat, provide carbohydrates and protein components and to provide bulk to the patty. They also provide
        texture to the burger, which can change depending on the type of grain used. This texture and look is important
        as they wish to make the patty look like a beef patty.</P>
    <h3>Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Vegetables such as corn, carrots, and mushrooms, provide the patty with texture and taste. Additionally, they
        provide moisture when heated. This allows the disc shape without breaking apart easily. The vegetables also
        provide nutrients with the addition of some vitamins and minerals.</p>
    <h3>Dry ingredients</h3>
    <p>Adding dry ingredients, such as oats, flours, nuts, or breadcrumbs, can absorb excess moisture and liquid, which
        results in the patty sticking together tightly. This could turn the moist veggie patties into a sticky
        consistency, which also helps the patties shape easily. Dry ingredients provide proteins and fiber, which
        add nutritional value to the veggie patty. Dry ingredients, such as walnuts and almonds, are also rich in
        energy, vitamins and minerals.</p>
    <h3>Stabilizers</h3>
    <p>Tapioca starch and vegetable gum are two common ingredients used as stabilizers in veggie burger. Tapioca starch
        is often used as a thickening agent for manufactured foods due to its cheaper price. It gets sticky once it is
        wet, which helps to hold the burger patty tightly together. This prevents the patty from breaking apart.
        Vegetable gum provides negligible nutrients, but it also helps to hold everything together in the patty.</p>
    <h3>Oils</h3>
    <p>Oils, such as safflower, coconut, and olive oil, can lubricate the grain mix, and allow further cooking
        processing when the wheat is added. This facilitates the Maillard reaction and makes the veggie patty taste
        better by bringing out its flavors. Oils can also prevent the ingredients from sticking to the mixing machine,
        thus allowing them to be mixed well and heated together.</p>
    <h3>Preservatives</h3>
    <p>Salt is typically used for flavor, but may be used as a preservative in veggie burgers. With the use of salt, the
        water activity of the food is reduced. This helps prevent the growth of micro-organisms and prolongs the shelf
        life of the food.</p>
