    <h1 #top>Hamburger</h1>
    <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
        beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often
        a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped
        with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>

    <p> The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the
        term patty is rarely used or can even refer to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for
        clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger,
        bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger. In Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, a piece of chicken
        breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which would generally not be considered to be a burger in the
        United States; Americans would generally call it a chicken sandwich, but in Australian English and New Zealand
        English a sandwich requires sliced bread (not a bun), so it would not be considered a sandwich.</p>

    <p></p> Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and other restaurants. There are many
    international and regional variations of hamburger.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>As versions of the meal have been served for over a century, its origin remains obscure. The 1758 edition of
        the book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse included a recipe in 1758 as "Hamburgh
        sausage", which suggested to serve it "roasted with toasted bread under it." A similar snack was also popular in
        Hamburg by the name "Rundstück warm" ("bread roll warm") in 1869 or earlier, and supposedly eaten by many
        emigrants on their way to America, but may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than Frikadeller. It has been
        suggested that Hamburg steak served between two pieces of bread and frequently eaten by Jewish passengers
        travelling from Hamburg to New York on Hamburg America Line vessels (which began operations in 1847) became so
        well known that the shipping company gave its name to the dish. Each of these may mark the invention of the
        hamburger and explain the name.</p>

    <p></p> There is a reference to a "Hamburg steak" as early as 1884 in the Boston Journal.[OED, under "steak"] On
    July 5,
    1896, the Chicago Daily Tribune made a highly specific claim regarding a "hamburger sandwich" in an article
    about a "Sandwich Car": "A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for
    which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range.</p>
