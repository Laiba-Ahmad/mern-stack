    <h1 #top>Flat Coffee</h1>
    <p>A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam (steamed milk with small, fine bubbles and a
        glossy or velvety consistency). It is comparable to a latte, but smaller in volume and with less microfoam,
        therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk, and milk that is more velvety in consistency – allowing
        the espresso to dominate the flavour, while being supported by the milk.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A flat white is generally served in a ceramic cup with saucer. Milk is frothed and foamy as it would be for a
        latte but held back to around 20 mm (0.8 in) of microfoam, creating a meniscus. Differences in the size of the
        foam layer differ between regions, with some preferring as little as 1 mm (0.04 in). Key to the beverage is the
        crema being coaxed into the meniscus resulting in a uniform dark brown colour across the top of the beverage.
        Allowing the beverage to stand before drinking enhances the experience as the meniscus thickens and adds texture
        to each sip, resulting in distinct sip rings/tide marks as the beverage is consumed.</p>
    <p>According to a survey of industry commentators a flat white has several defining characteristics, chief among
        which is a thin layer of velvety microfoam (hence the 'flat' in flat white), as opposed to the significantly
        thicker layer of foam in a traditional cappuccino.</p>
