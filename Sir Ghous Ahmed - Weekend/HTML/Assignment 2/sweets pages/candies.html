    <h1 #top>Candy</h1>
    <p>This article is about the type of confection generally. For other uses, see Candy (disambiguation) and Candies
        (disambiguation).
        "Sweets" redirects here. For other uses, see Sweets (disambiguation).</p>
    <p>Candy, also called sweets (British English) or lollies (Australian English, New Zealand English), is a
        confection that features sugar as a principal ingredient. The category, called sugar confectionery, encompasses
        any sweet confection, including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have
        been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be candied.</p>

    <p> Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or sugar substitutes. Unlike a
        cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces.
        However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food. Unlike sweet pastries served for a
        dessert course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack
        between meals. Each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes candy rather than dessert. The same food may
        be a candy in one culture and a dessert in another.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The word candy entered the English language from the Old French çucre candi ("sugar candy"). The French term
        probably has earlier roots in the Arabic qandi, Persian qand and Sanskrit khanda, all words for sugar.</p>

    <p> Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical South and Southeast Asia. Pieces of sugar were produced by boiling sugarcane
        juice in ancient India and consumed as khanda. Between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, the
        Persians, followed by the Greeks, discovered the people in India and their "reeds that produce honey without
        bees". They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture.</p>

    <p> Before sugar was readily available, candy was based on honey. Honey was used in Ancient China, the Middle
        East, Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire to coat fruits and flowers to preserve them or to create forms of
        candy. Candy is still served in this form today, though now it is more typically seen as a type of garnish.</p>

    <p> Before the Industrial Revolution, candy was often considered a form of medicine, either used to calm the
        digestive system or cool a sore throat. In the Middle Ages candy appeared on the tables of only the most wealthy
        at first. At that time, it began as a combination of spices and sugar used as an aid to digestion. Banquet hosts
        typically served these types of 'candies' at banquets for their guests. One of these candies, sometimes called
        chamber spice, was made with cloves, ginger, aniseed, juniper berries, almonds and pine kernels dipped in melted
        sugar.</p>

    <p> The Middle English word candy began to be used in the late 13th century.</p>

    <p> The first candy came to America during the early 18th century from Britain and France. Only a few of the early
        colonists were proficient in sugar work and sugary treats were generally only enjoyed by the very wealthy. Even
        the simplest form of candy – rock candy, made from crystallized sugar – was considered a luxury.</p>

            <h2>Milk chocolate</h2>
            <p>Milk chocolate is a form of solid chocolate containing cocoa, sugar and milk. It is the most consumed
                type of chocolate and it is used in a wide diversity of bars, tablets and other confectionery products.
                Milk chocolate contains less cocoa solids than dark chocolate but, like white chocolate, contains milk
                solids. While taste (akin to chocolate milk) and texture have been key to its success, milk chocolate
                has also historically been promoted as a healthy food, particularly for children. Recent evidence has
                shown that it may provide antioxidant health benefits.</p>

            <p> Major milk chocolate producers include Ferrero, Hershey, Mondelez, Mars and Nestlé. Between them, they
                are responsible for over half of the chocolate sold worldwide. Although four-fifths of all milk
                chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed in China and
                Latin America.</p>

            <p> Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in pre-Columbian times, and upon its
                introduction to Western Europe. The word chocolate arrived in the English language about 1600, but
                initially described dark chocolate. The first use of the term "milk chocolate" was for a beverage
                brought to London from Jamaica in 1687, but it was not until the Swiss inventor Daniel Peter
                successfully combined cocoa and condensed milk in 1875 that the milk chocolate bar was invented.
                Switzerland quickly developed as the centre of milk chocolate production, particularly after the
                development of the conche by Rodolphe Lindt, and was increasingly exporting to an international market.
                Milk chocolate became mainstream at the beginning of the twentieth century following the launch of
                Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk and the Hershey bar, inducing a dramatic increase in world cocoa consumption.
                At the same time, milk chocolate was combined with other ingredients, like nougat, to form a wide
                variety of bars, including Toblerone in 1908, Goo Goo Cluster in 1912 and Kit Kat in 1935. The global
                spread of milk chocolate continued into the next century, along with increasing consolidation in the
                market. A more recent development has been the rise of Fair Trade and UTZ Certified chocolate aiming to
                provide ethical assurances for customers. In 2018, the market for milk chocolate was worth $63.2
                billion.</p>

            <h2>White chocolate</h2>
            <p>White chocolate is a confectionery typically made of sugar, milk, and cocoa butter, but no cocoa solids.
                It is pale ivory in color, and lacks many of the compounds found in milk, dark, and other chocolates.
                It is solid at room temperature (25 °C (77 °F)) because the melting point of cocoa butter, the only
                white cocoa bean component, is 35 °C (95 °F).</p>

            <p> As for the other two main types of chocolate (dark and milk), white chocolate is used for chocolate bars
                or as a coating in confectionery.</p>

            <h2>Dark chocolate</h2>
            <p>Dark chocolate is a form of chocolate containing cocoa solids and cocoa butter without the milk or butter
                found in milk chocolate. Dark chocolate without added sweetener is known as bitter chocolate or
                unsweetened chocolate. As for the other two main types of chocolate (milk and white), dark chocolate
                is used for chocolate bars or as a coating in confectionery.</p>

            <p> Government and industry standards of what products may be labeled "dark chocolate" vary by country and
                market.</p>

            <p> There is no high-quality evidence for any health effects of dark chocolate, such as on blood
                pressure.</p>
