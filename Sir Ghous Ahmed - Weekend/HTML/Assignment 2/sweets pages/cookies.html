    <h1 #top>Cookie</h1>
    <p>A cookie (American English), or a biscuit (British English), is a baked or cooked snack or dessert that is
        typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It
        may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.</p>

    <p> Most English-speaking countries call crunchy cookies "biscuits", except for the United States and Canada, where
        "biscuit" refers to a type of quick bread. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called "cookies" even in the United
        Kingdom.[3] Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars.</p>

    <p> Biscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and
        Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are
        often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea and sometimes dunked, an approach which releases more
        flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars,[4] while also softening their texture. Factory-made cookies
        are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries
        and coffeehouses.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or else for just long enough to ensure soft interior. Other types of
        cookies are not baked at all, such as varieties of peanut butter cookies that use solidified chocolate rather
        than set eggs and wheat gluten as a binder. Cookies are produced in a wide variety of styles, using an array
        of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits.</p>

    <p> A general theory of cookies may be formulated in the following way. Despite its descent from cakes and other
        sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in
        cakes serves to make the batter as thin as possible, the better to allow bubbles—responsible for a cake's
        fluffiness—to form. In the cookie the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether in the form
        of butter, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a far higher
        temperature. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs in place of water is much denser after removal from the oven.
    </p>

    <p> Rather than evaporating as water does in a baking cake, oils in cookies remain. These oils saturate the cavities
        created during baking by bubbles of escaping gases. These gases are primarily composed of steam vaporized from
        the egg whites and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most
        texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture
        (namely oil) that does not render soggy the food it has soaked into.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The need for nutritious, easy-to-store, easy-to-carry, and long-lasting foods on long journeys, in particular at
        sea, was initially solved by taking live food along with a butcher/cook. However, this took up additional space
        on what were either horse-powered treks or small ships, reducing the time of travel before additional food was
        required. This resulted in early armies' adopting the style of hunter-foraging.</p>

    <p></p> The introduction of the baking of processed cereals including the creation of flour provided a more reliable
    source of food. Egyptian sailors carried a flat, brittle loaf of millet bread called dhourra cake while the
    Romans had a biscuit called buccellum. Roman cookbook Apicius describes: "a thick paste of fine wheat flour
    was boiled and spread out on a plate. When it had dried and hardened, it was cut up and then fried until crisp,
    then served with honey and pepper."</p>

    <p></p> Many early physicians believed that most medicinal problems were associated with digestion. Hence, for both
    sustenance and avoidance of illness, a daily consumption of a biscuit was considered good for health.</p>

    <p> Hard biscuits soften as they age. To solve this problem, early bakers attempted to create the hardest biscuit
        possible. Because it is so hard and dry, if properly stored and transported, navies' hardtack will survive rough
        handling and high temperature. Baked hard, it can be kept without spoiling for years as long as it is kept dry.
        For long voyages, hardtack was baked four times, rather than the more common two. To soften hardtack for
        eating, it was often dunked in brine, coffee, or some other liquid or cooked into a skillet meal.</p>

    <p> The collection Sayings of the Desert Fathers mentions that Anthony the Great (who lived in the 4th century AD)
        ate biscuits and the text implies that it was a popular food among monks of the time and region.</p>

    <p> At the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588, the daily allowance on board a Royal Navy ship was one pound of
        biscuit plus one gallon of beer. Samuel Pepys in 1667 first regularised naval victualling with varied and
        nutritious rations. Royal Navy hardtack during Queen Victoria's reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence
        Victualling Yard at Gosport, Hampshire, stamped with the Queen's mark and the number of the oven in which they
        were baked. When machinery was introduced into the process the dough was thoroughly mixed and rolled into sheets
        about 2 yards (1.8 m) long and 1 yard (0.9 m) wide which were stamped in one stroke into about sixty
        hexagonal-shaped biscuits. This left the sheets sufficiently coherent to be placed in the oven in one piece and
        when baked they were easy to separate. The hexagonal shape rather than traditional circular biscuits meant a
        saving in material and was easier to pack. Biscuits remained an important part of the Royal Navy sailor's
        diet until the introduction of canned foods. Canned meat was first marketed in 1814; preserved beef in tins was
        officially added to Royal Navy rations in 1847.</p>
