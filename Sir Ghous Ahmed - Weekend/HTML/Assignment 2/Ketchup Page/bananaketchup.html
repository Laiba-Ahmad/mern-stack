    <h1>Banana ketchup.</h1>
    <p>Banana ketchup (or banana sauce) is a popular Philippine fruit ketchup condiment made from banana, sugar,
        vinegar, and spices. Its natural color is brownish-yellow but it is often dyed red to resemble tomato ketchup.
        Banana ketchup was first produced in the Philippines during World War II due to a wartime shortage of tomatoes
        but a comparatively high production of bananas.</p>

    <h2>Use</h2>
    <p>In Filipino households, this condiment is used on many assorted dishes: Filipino spaghetti, omelettes (torta),
        hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, fish, charcoal-grilled pork barbecue and chicken skewers, fried chicken, and
        other meats.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Filipina food technologist Maria Y. Orosa (1892â€“1945) is credited with inventing the product.</p>

    <p>
        In 1942, banana ketchup was first mass-produced commercially by Magdalo V. Francisco Sr. who founded the
        brand name Mafran (a portmanteau of his given name and surname) which he registered with the Bureau of
        Patents.[citation needed] Francisco sought funding from Tirso T. Reyes to expand his business and therefore the
        Universal Food Corporation (UFC) was formed in 1960.</p>
