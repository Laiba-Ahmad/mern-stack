    <h1 #top>Juice</h1>
    <p>Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It
        can also refer to liquids that are flavored with concentrate or other biological food sources, such as meat or
        seafood, such as clam juice. Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in
        foods or other beverages, such as smoothies. Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of
        pasteurization methods enabled its preservation without using fermentation (which is used in wine
        production). The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and
        Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increases with a
        country's income level.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Groups of grape pits dated to 8000 BCE show early evidence of juice production; although it is thought that the
        grapes may have been alternatively used to produce wine.[citation needed] One of the first regularly produced
        juices was lemonade, appearing in 16th-century Italy, as an import, after its conception in the Middle East.
        Orange juice originated in the 17th century. In the 18th century, James Lind linked citrus fruits to the
        prevention of scurvy, which, a century later, led to the implementation of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1867,
        requiring all ocean-bound British ships to carry citrus-based juice on board.[citation needed]</p>

    <p> In 1869, a dentist by the name of Thomas B. Welch developed a pasteurization method that allowed for the storage
        of juice, without the juice fermenting into alcohol. His method involved filtering squeezed grape juice into
        bottles, sealing them with cork and wax, and then placing them in boiling water. This method kills the yeast
        responsible for fermentation. He then sold his new product as "Dr Welch's Unfermented Wine". In the late
        18th-century United States, circulation of foreign fruit juices were heavily regulated by tariffs. The McKinley
        Tariff Act of 1890 increased import taxes from 38 to 49.5 percent, and set taxes on fruit juices based on the
        alcohol content of the drink. Juices with 18% or less alcohol were taxed 60 cents per gallon, while anything
        above 18% was taxed US$2.50 per proof gallon.</p>

    <h2>Health effects</h2>
    <p>Juices are often consumed for their perceived health benefits. For example, orange juice with natural or added
        vitamin C, folic acid, and potassium. Juice provides nutrients such as carotenoids, polyphenols and vitamin
         C that offer health benefits.</p>

    <p> High consumption of fruit juice with added sugar may be linked to weight gain, but not all studies have
        shown this effect. If 100% from fruit, juice can help meet daily intake recommendations for some
        nutrients.</p>
    <h2>100% fruit juice</h2>
    <p>Research suggests that 100% fruit juice is not associated with increased risk of diabetes. A 2018
        review concluded that 100% fruit juice increases the risk of tooth decay in children but there is "no conclusive
        evidence that consumption of 100% fruit juice has adverse health effects."</p>
    <h2>Cranberry juice</h2>
    <p>Preliminary research indicates that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of urinary tract
        infections in women with frequent infections, and a more substantial Cochrane review concludes that there is
        some evidence that cranberry products reduces the risk of symptomatic urinary tract infections for women,
        children and people following intervention, but not for the elderly, or people with bladder emptying problems,
        or for pregnant women. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more
        than 30% of people.</p>
    <h2>Negative effects</h2>
    <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics as of 2017 says that fruit juice should not be given to children under age one
        due to the lack of nutritional benefit. For children ages one to six, intake of fruit juice should be
        limited to less than 4–6 oz (110–170 g) per day (about a half to three-quarters of a cup) due to its high
        sugar and low fiber content compared to fruit. Overconsumption of fruit juices may reduce nutrient intake
        compared to eating whole fruits, and may produce diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, bloating, or tooth
        decay.</p>

    <p> Overconsumption of fruits and fruit juice may contribute to dental decay and cavities via the effect of fruit
        acids on tooth enamel. Longitudinal prospective cohort studies showed a significantly increased risk of type
        2 diabetes when juices with added sugars were consumed compared to eating whole fruits.[33] A 2014 review found
        that higher intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice was significantly associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.
    </p>

    <p> Overconsumption of fruit juice with added sugars has also been linked to childhood obesity. The American Journal
        of Public Health proposed that the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 in the United States eliminate 100%
        fruit juices and substitute instead with whole fruits.</p>
