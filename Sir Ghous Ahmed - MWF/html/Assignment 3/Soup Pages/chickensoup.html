    <h1>Chicken soup</h1>
    <p>Chicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients. The classic
        chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are
        pasta, noodles, dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley. Chicken soup has acquired the reputation of a folk
        remedy for colds and influenza, and in many countries is considered a comfort food.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Humans were already boiling food by the time that chicken was domesticated in the neolithic period, so it is
        likely that chickens were being boiled for soup.</p>

    <p>Modern American chicken soup, which typically includes root vegetables such as carrot, onion, leeks and celery,
        was a staple across Northern Europe and was brought to the United States by immigrants.</p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery
        root; herbs such as bay leaves, parsley and dill; other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves,
        lettuce, or tomatoes; and black pepper. The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a
        covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. Saffron or turmeric are
        sometimes added as a yellow colorant.
