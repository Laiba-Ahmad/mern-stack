    <h1 #top>Cake</h1>
    <p>Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, and is usually baked. In their oldest
        forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or
        elaborate, and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.</p>
    <p>The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil or margarine), a liquid, and a
        leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or
        or candied fruit.</p>
    fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients.
    Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit,
    whipped cream or syrups),[1] iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders,
    <p>Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and
        birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are
        centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into
        cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so
        that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.</p>

    <h2>History
    </h2>
    <p>The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka".</p>

    <p> The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (plakous), which was derived from the word for "flat", πλακόεις
        (plakoeis). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also had a cake called
        "satura", which was a flat heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became "placenta" which was
        derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.</p>
    <p> The Greeks invented beer as a leavener, frying fritters in olive oil, and cheesecakes using goat's milk. In
        ancient Rome, the basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which produced a sweet
        and cake-like baked good. Latin poet Ovid refers to his and his brother's birthday party and cake in his
        first book of exile, Tristia.</p>

    <p></p>Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a "cake" and "bread"
    were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking,
    while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.</p>

    <p> Sponge cakes, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during the Renaissance, possibly in Spain.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Cake mixes</h2>
    <P>During the Great Depression, there was a surplus of molasses and the need to provide easily made food to millions
        of economically depressed people in the United States.[8] One company patented a cake-bread mix to deal with
        this economic situation, and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In so doing, cake, as it is
        known today, became a mass-produced good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty.</P>

    <P> Later, during the post-war boom, other American companies (notably General Mills) developed this idea further,
        marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in the
        1950s, marketers discovered that baking cakes, once a task at which housewives could exercise skill and
        creativity, had become dispiriting. This was a period in American ideological history when women, retired from
        the war-time labor force, were confined to the domestic sphere, while still exposed to the blossoming
        consumerism in the US.[9] This inspired psychologist Ernest Dichter to find a solution to the cake mix problem
        in the frosting.[10] Since making the cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend
        their creative energy on cake decorating inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of
        elaborately decorated cakes.</P>

    <P> Ever since cake in a box has become a staple of supermarkets and is complemented with frosting in a can.</P>

    <h2>Chocolate cake</h2>
    <p>Chocolate cakes are butter cakes, sponge cakes, or other cakes flavored with melted chocolate or cocoa
        powder. German chocolate cake is a variety of chocolate cake. Fudge cakes are chocolate cakes that contain
        fudge.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Butter cake</h2>
    <p>Butter cakes are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They rely on the combination of butter and
        sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter. A classic pound cake is made with a
        pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Another type of butter cake that takes its names from the
        proportion of ingredients used is 1-2-3-4 cake: 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3 cups flour, and 4 eggs.
        According to Beth Tartan, this cake was one of the most common among the American pioneers who settled North
        Carolina.</p>

    <p> Baking powder is in many butter cakes, such as Victoria sponge. The ingredients are sometimes mixed without
        creaming the butter, using recipes for simple and quick cakes.[citation needed]</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Sponge cake</h2>
    <p>Sponge cakes (or foam cakes) are made from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. Traditional sponge cakes are leavened
        only with eggs. They rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally of beaten eggs) to provide
        leavening, sometimes with a bit of baking powder or other chemical leaven added. Egg-leavened sponge cakes are
        thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast.</p>

    <p>Angel food cake is a white cake that uses only the whites of the eggs and is traditionally baked in a tube pan.
        The French Génoise is a sponge cake that includes clarified butter. Highly decorated sponge cakes with lavish
        toppings are sometimes called gateau, the French word for cake. Chiffon cakes are sponge cakes with vegetable
        oil, which adds moistness.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Coffee cake</h2>
    <p>Coffee cake is generally thought of as a cake to serve with coffee or tea at breakfast or a coffee break. Some
        types use yeast as a leavening agent while others use baking soda or baking powder. These cakes often have a
        crumb topping called streusel or a light glaze drizzle.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Flourless cake</h2>
    <p>Baked flourless cakes include baked cheesecakes and flourless chocolate cakes.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Layer cakes</h2>
    <p>Layer cakes are cakes made with layers of sponge or butter cake, filled with cream, jam or other filling to hold
        the layers together.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>One egg cake</h2>
    <p>One egg cakes are made with one egg. They can be made with butter or vegetable shortening. One egg cake
        was an economical recipe when using two eggs for each cake was too costly.</p>
