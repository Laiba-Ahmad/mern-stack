    <h1 #top>Mozzarella cheese</h1>
    <p>Mozzarella (English: /ˌmɒtsəˈrɛlə/, Italian: [mottsaˈrɛlla]; Neapolitan: muzzarella [muttsaˈrɛllə]) is a southern
        Italian cheese traditionally made from Italian buffalo's milk by the pasta filata method.</p>

    <p> Fresh mozzarella is generally white but when seasoned it turns to a light yellow depending on the animal's
        diet. Due to its high moisture content, it is traditionally served the day after it is made but can be
        kept in brine for up to a week or longer when sold in vacuum-sealed packages. Low-moisture mozzarella can be
        kept refrigerated for up to a month, though some shredded low-moisture mozzarella is sold with a shelf life
        of up to six months. Mozzarella is used for most types of pizza and several pasta dishes or served with
        sliced tomatoes and basil in Caprese salad.</p>

    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>Mozzarella di bufala is traditionally produced solely from the milk of the Italian Mediterranean buffalo. A whey
        starter is added from the previous batch that contains thermophilic bacteria, and the milk is left to ripen so
        the bacteria can multiply. Then, rennet is added to coagulate the milk. After coagulation, the curd is cut into
        large, 2.5–5 cm (1.0–2.0 in) pieces, and left to sit so the curds firm up in a process known as
        healing.[citation needed]</p>

    <p> After the curd heals, it is further cut into 1–1.5 cm (0.4–0.6 in) pieces. The curds are stirred and heated to
        separate the curds from the whey. The whey is then drained from the curds and the curds are placed in a hoop to
        form a solid mass. The curd mass is left until the pH is at around 5.2–5.5, which is the point when the cheese
        can be stretched and kneaded to produce a delicate consistency—this process is generally known as pasta filata.
        According to the mozzarella di bufala trade association, "The cheese-maker kneads it with his hands, like a
        baker making bread, until he obtains a smooth, shiny paste, a strand of which he pulls out and lops off, forming
        the individual mozzarella". It is then typically formed into cylinder shapes or in plait. In Italy, a
        "rubbery" consistency is generally considered not satisfactory; the cheese is expected to be softer.[citation
