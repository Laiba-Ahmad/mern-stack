    <h1 #top>Cheese</h1>
    <p>Cheese is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk
        protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk (usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep).
        During production, milk is usually acidified and either the enzymes of rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar
        activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and
        pressed into finished cheese. Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout.
    </p>
    <p> Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are produced in various countries. Their styles, textures and flavors
        depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the
        butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged. Herbs, spices, or
        wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding
        annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives, or cranberries. A
        cheesemonger, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting, purchasing, receiving, storing
        and ripening cheeses.</p>
        
        <p> For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are
            acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet
            completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of
            the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family.
            Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.</p>
            
            <p>Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and
        phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep
        depends on the type of cheese. Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or
        goat's milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows
        selling when markets are favorable. Vacuum packaging of block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic bags
        with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st
        century. Plant-based cheese has a lower carbon footprint.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive evidence indicating
            where cheesemaking originated, whether in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East. Earliest proposed dates for
            the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE, when sheep were first domesticated. Since animal skins
            and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it
            is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made
            from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the
            stomach. There is a legend—with variations—about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this
            method of storing milk.</p>
            <p> The earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5500 BCE and is found in what
                is now Kuyavia, Poland, where strainers coated with milk-fat molecules have been found.</p>
                
                <p> Cheesemaking may have begun independently of this by the pressing and salting of curdled milk to preserve it.
                    Observation that the effect of making cheese in an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds may
                    have led to the deliberate addition of rennet. Early archeological evidence of Egyptian cheese has been found in
                    Egyptian tomb murals, dating to about 2000 BCE. A 2018 scientific paper stated that the world's oldest
                    cheese, dating to approximately 1200 BCE (3200 years before present), was found in ancient Egyptian
                    tombs.</p>
                    
                    <p> The earliest cheeses were likely quite sour and salty, similar in texture to rustic cottage cheese or feta, a
                        crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese. Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than the Middle East,
                        required less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for
                        useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their respective flavors. The earliest ever discovered preserved
                        cheese was found in the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China, dating back as early as 1615 BCE (3600 years
                        before present).</p>
