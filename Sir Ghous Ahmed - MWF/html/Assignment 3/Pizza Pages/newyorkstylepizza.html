    <h1 #top>New York–style pizza</h1>
    <p>New York–style pizza is pizza made with a characteristically large hand-tossed thin crust, often sold in wide
        slices to go. The crust is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough beneath its
        toppings to be folded in half to eat. Traditional toppings are simply tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella
        cheese.This was a popular meal amongst poor Italians due to the ratio of product from the limited produce.</p>

    <p> This style evolved in the U.S. from the pizza that originated in New York City in the early 1900s, itself
        derived from the Neapolitan-style pizza made in Italy. Today, it is the dominant style eaten in the New York
        metropolitan area states of New York and New Jersey, and is variously popular throughout the United States.
        Regional variations exist throughout the Northeast and elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The first pizzeria in the United States, Lombardi's, was founded by Gennaro Lombardi in New York City's Little
        Italy in 1905, though this has recently been challenged by author Peter Regas.[failed verification] An
        immigrant pizzaiolo (pizza maker) from Naples, he opened a grocery store in 1897; eight years later, it was
        licensed to sell pizza by New York State. An employee, Antonio Totonno Pero, began making pizza, which sold
        for five cents a pie. Many people, however, could not afford a whole pie and instead would offer what they could
        in return for a corresponding sized slice, which was wrapped in paper tied with string. In 1924, Totonno left
        Lombardi's to open his own pizzeria on Coney Island, called Totonno's.</p>
    <p> The original pizzerias in New York used coal-fired ovens and baked their pizza with the cheese on the bottom and
        sauce on top.[citation needed] By 2010, over 400 pizza restaurants existed in New York City, with hundreds more
        of varied cuisine also offering the dish.</p>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>New York–style pizza is traditionally hand-tossed, consisting in its basic form of a light layer of tomato
        sauce sprinkled with dry, grated, full-fat mozzarella cheese; additional toppings are placed over the
        cheese. Pies are typically around 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm) in diameter, and commonly cut into eight
        slices. These large wide slices are often eaten as fast food while folded in half along the crust both for
        convenience—allowing the slice to be eaten one-handed—and to control the flow of oil running off the pie in both
        directions.</p>
    <p>New York–style pizza gets its distinguishing crust from the high-gluten bread flour with which it is made.
        Minerals present in New York City's tap water supply are also credited with giving the dough in metro area pies
        its characteristic texture and flavor. Some out-of-state pizza bakers even transport the water
        cross-country for the sake of authenticity. However, many dispute this, claiming a similarly high-quality
        pizza can be made elsewhere with otherwise similar techniques and ingredients.[citation needed]</p>
    <p> Typical condiments include dried oregano, dried red chili pepper flakes, garlic powder, dried basil, and grated
        Parmesan cheese.[citation needed]</p>
