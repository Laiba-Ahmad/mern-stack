    <h1 #top>Ketchup</h1>
    <p>Ketchup or catsup is a table condiment with a sweet and sour flavor. The unmodified term ("ketchup") now
        typically refers to tomato ketchup, although early recipes used egg whites, mushrooms, oysters, grapes,
        mussels, or walnuts, among other ingredients.</p>

    <p> Tomato ketchup is made from tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar, with seasonings and spices. The spices and flavors
        vary, but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, and mustard, and sometimes
        include celery, cinnamon, or ginger.[citation needed] The market leader in the United States (60% market share)
        and the United Kingdom (82%) is Heinz Tomato Ketchup. Tomato ketchup is often used as a condiment to
        dishes that are usually served hot and are fried or greasy: french fries and other potato dishes, hamburgers,
        hot dogs, chicken tenders, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, and grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is
        sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, and the flavor may be
        replicated as an additive flavoring for snacks, such as potato chips.</p>

    <h2>Separation</h2>
    <p>Ketchup is one of the many products that are leachable, meaning that the water within the product migrates
        together as the larger molecules within the product sediment, ultimately causing water to separate out. This
        forms a layer of water on top of the ketchup due to the molecular instability within the product. This
        instability is caused by interactions between hydrophobic molecules and charged molecules within the ketchup
        suspension.</p>

    <p> Pectin is a polysaccharide within tomatoes that has the ability to bind to itself and to other molecules,
        especially water, around it. This enables it to create a gel-like matrix, dependent on the amount within the
        solution. Water is a large part of ketchup, due to it being 80% of the composition of distilled vinegar. In
        order for the water within the ketchup to be at the lowest possible energy state, all of the hydrogen bonds that
        are able to be made within the matrix must be made. The water bound to the polysaccharide moves more slowly
        within the matrix, which is unfavorable with respect to entropy. The increased order within the
        polysaccharide-water complex gives rise to a high-energy state, in which the water will want to be relieved.
        This concept implies that water will more favorably bind with itself because of the increased disorder between
        water molecules. This is partially the cause for water leaching out of solution when left undisturbed for a
        short period of time.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>In the United Kingdom, ketchup was historically prepared with mushrooms as a primary ingredient, rather than
        tomatoes. Ketchup recipes began to appear in British and then American cookbooks in the 18th century.
        The term ketchup first appeared in 1682. In the United States, mushroom ketchup dates back to at least 1770,
        and was prepared by British colonists in the Thirteen Colonies.</p>
