    <h1 #top>What Is Italian cuisine:</h1>
    <p> (Italian: cucina italiana, pronounced [kuˈtʃiːna itaˈljaːna]) is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the
        ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula and later spread around the
        world together with waves of Italian diaspora.Some of these foods were imported from other cultures.
        Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes,
        capsicums, maize and sugar beet—the latter introduced in quantity in the 18th century.It is one of the
        best-known and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide.</p>
    <p>Italian cuisine includes deeply rooted traditions common to the whole country, as well as all the regional
        gastronomies, different from each other, especially between the north, the centre and the south of Italy, which
        are in continuous exchange.Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations
        throughout the country.Italian cuisine offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and
        copied around the world.The cuisine has influenced several other cuisines around the world, chiefly that of
        the United States.</p>
    <p>One of the main characteristics of Italian cuisine is its simplicity, with many dishes made up of few
        ingredients, and therefore Italian cooks often rely on the quality of the ingredients, rather than the
        complexity of preparation.Italian cuisine is at the origin of a turnover of more than €200 billion
        worldwide.The most popular dishes and recipes, over the centuries, have often been created by ordinary
        people more so than by chefs, which is why many Italian recipes are suitable for home and daily cooking,
        respecting regional specificities, privileging only raw materials and ingredients from the region of origin of
        the dish and preserving its seasonality.</p>
    <p>The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables.
        Cheese, cold cuts and wine are central to Italian cuisine, and along with pizza and coffee (especially espresso)
        form part of Italian gastronomic culture. Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as
        citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa,
        vanilla and cinnamon. Gelato,tiramisù and cassata are among the most famous examples of Italian
        desserts, cakes and patisserie. Italian cuisine relies heavily on traditional products; the country has a large
        number of traditional specialities protected under EU law. Italy is the world's largest producer of wine, as
        well as the country with the widest variety of indigenous grapevine varieties in the world.</p>

    <h2>History:</h2>
    <p>Italian cuisine has developed over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy did not unite until the
        19th century, the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were
        very important at that time evident from the cookbook (Apicius) which dates to the first century BC.Through
        the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of
        the New World have influenced its development. Italian cuisine started to form after the fall of the Roman
        Empire when different cities began to separate and form their own traditions. Many different types of bread and
        pasta were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation.</p>
    <p>The country was then split for a long time and influenced by surrounding countries such as Spain, France and
        others in Central Europe. Trade and the location on the Silk Road with its routes to Asia also influenced the
        local development of special dishes. Due to the climatic conditions and the different proximity to the sea,
        different basic foods and spices were available from region to region. Regional cuisine is represented by some
        of the major cities in Italy. For example, Milan (in the north of Italy) is known for risottos, Trieste (in the
        northeast of Italy) is known for multicultural food, Bologna (in the centre of Italy) is known for its
        tortellini, and Naples (in the south of Italy) is famous for its pizzas.[29] Spaghetti for example is believed
        to have spread across Africa to Sicily and then on to Naples.</p>
