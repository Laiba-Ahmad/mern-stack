    <p>
        Basmati, pronounced ['bɑːsmət̪iː], is a variety of long, slender-grained aromatic rice which is traditionally
        grown in India, Pakistan, and Nepal.As of 2019, India accounted for 65% of the international trade in
        basmati rice, while Pakistan accounted for the remaining 35%.Many countries use domestically grown
        basmati rice crops;however, basmati is geographically exclusive to certain districts of India and Pakistan.

    <p>According to the Indian Government agency APEDA, a rice variety is eligible to be called basmati if it has a
        minimum average precooked milled rice length of 6.61 mm (0.260 in) and average precooked milled rice breadth of
        up to 2 mm (0.079 in), among other parameters.</p>
    <h2>History:</h2>
    <p>Basmati rice is believed to have been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. Earliest mention of
        Basmati rice has been made in the epic Heer Ranjha composed by the Punjabi poet Varis Shah in 1766.</p>

    <h2>In Pakistan:</h2>
    <p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Pakistan's original Basmatic area lies in the Kalar
        bowl between the Ravi and Chenab rivers. Almost all the cultivation of Basmati takes place in the Punjab
        province where total production was 2.47 million metric tons (2,430,000 long tons; 2,720,000 short tons) in
        2010. In fiscal year 2020, basmati exports stood at 890,207 tonnes valuing $790 million.[22] In
