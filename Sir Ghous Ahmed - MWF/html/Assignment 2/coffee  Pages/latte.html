    <h1>Latte Coffee</h1>
    <p>Caffè latte (Italian: [kafˌfɛ lˈlatte]), often shortened to just latte (/ˈlɑːteɪ, ˈlæteɪ/) in
        English, is a coffee drink of Italian origin made with espresso and steamed milk. Variants include the
        chocolate-flavored mocha or replacing the coffee with another beverage base such as masala chai (spiced Indian
        tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; alternatives to milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also used.
    </p>

    <p> The term comes from the Italian caffellatte or caffè latte, from caffè e latte, literally "coffee and milk";
        in English orthography either or both words sometimes have an accent on the final e (a hyperforeignism in the
        case of *latté, or to indicate it is pronounced, not the more-common silent final e of English). In northern
        Europe and Scandinavia, the term café au lait has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso and
        milk. In France, cafè latte is from the original name of the beverage (caffè latte); a combination of espresso
        and steamed milk equivalent to a "latte" is in French called grand crème and in German Milchkaffee.</p>

    <h2>Origin and history</h2>
    <p>Coffee, which was adopted from the Ottoman empire, and milk have been part of European cuisine since the
        seventeenth century. Caffè e latte, Milchkaffee, café au lait, and café con leche are domestic terms of
        traditional ways of drinking coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home. Public cafés in Europe and the
        USA seem to have no mention of the terms until the twentieth century, although Kapuziner is mentioned in
        Austrian coffee houses in Vienna and Trieste in the second half of 1700s as "coffee with cream, spices, and
        sugar" (being the origin of the Italian cappuccino).</p>

    <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term caffè e latte was first used in English in 1867 by William
        Dean Howells in his essay "Italian Journeys". Kenneth Davids maintains that "...breakfast drinks of this kind
        have existed in Europe for generations, but the (commercial) caffè version of this drink is an American
        invention".[dubious – discuss] The French term café au lait was used in cafés in several countries in western
        continental Europe from 1900 onward, however, the term café crème was used in France for coffee with milk or
        cream.</p>

    <p> The Austrian-Hungarian empire (Central Europe) had its own terminology for the coffees being served in coffee
        houses, while in German homes it was still called Milchkaffee. The Italians used the term caffè latte
        domestically, but it is not known from cafés such as Florian in Venice or any other coffee houses or places
        where coffee was served publicly. Even when the Italian espresso bar culture bloomed in the years after WWII
        both in Italy, and in cities such as Vienna and London, espresso and cappuccino are the terms used and latte is
        missing on coffee menus of that time.</p>

    <p>In Italian, latte (pronounced [ˈlatte]) means "milk"—so ordering a "latte" in Italy will get the customer a
        glass of milk.</p>

    <p> In Spanish, the phrase café con leche (coffee with milk) is used, which is by default served in a medium or
        large cup whereas the similar cortado (coffee with less milk) is served in a small cup.</p>

    <p> In English-speaking countries, latte is shorthand for caffelatte or caffellatte (from caffè e latte, "coffee and
        milk"), which is similar to the French café au lait, the Spanish café con leche, the Catalan cafè amb llet, or
        the Portuguese galão.</p>

    <p> The Caffe Mediterraneum in Berkeley, California claims that one of its early owners, Lino Meiorin, "invented"
        and "made the latte a standard drink" in the 1950s. The latte was popularized in Seattle, Washington in the
        early 1980s and spread more widely in the early 1990s.</p>

    <p>In northern Europe and Scandinavia, a similar "trend" started in the early 1980s as café au lait became popular
        again, prepared with espresso and steamed milk. Caffè latte started replacing this term around 1996–97 but both
        names often exist side by side and generally are more similar than different in preparation.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Current use</h2>
    <p>In Italy, caffè latte is almost always prepared at home, for breakfast only. This coffee beverage is brewed with
        a stovetop moka pot and poured into a cup containing heated milk. Unlike the "international" latte drink,
        generally, the milk in the Italian original is not foamed and sugar is added by the drinker, if at all.</p>

    <p>Outside Italy, typically a caffè latte is prepared in a 240 mL (8 US fl oz) glass or cup with one standard shot
        of espresso (either single, 30 mL or 1 US fl oz, or double, 60 mL or 2 US fl oz) and filled with steamed milk,
        with a layer of foamed milk approximately 12 mm (1⁄2 in) thick on the top. In the USA, a latte is often heavily
        sweetened with 3% sugar (or even more). When wanting to order this beverage in Italy, one should ask for a
        latte macchiato.</p>
    <p>The beverage is related to a cappuccino, the difference being that a cappuccino consists of espresso and steamed
        milk with a 20-millimetre-thick (0.79 in) layer of milk foam. A variant found in Australia and New Zealand that
        is similar to the latte is the flat white which is served in a smaller ceramic cup with warmed milk (without the
        layer of foam). In the United States this beverage is sometimes referred to as a wet cappuccino.

    <h2>Iced latte</h2>
    <p>In the United States, an iced latte is usually espresso and chilled milk poured over ice. Unlike a hot latte,
        it does not usually contain steamed milk or foam. Iced lattes often have sugar or flavoring syrups added,
        although purists prefer them to consist simply of coffee and milk; they also are served blended with ice.
        The espresso can be pre-chilled (sometimes as a mixture of espresso and milk) or frozen in advance to avoid
        warming up the drink.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Serving styles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In some establishments, lattes are served in a glass on a saucer with a napkin to hold the (sometimes hot)
            glass.</li>
        <li>Sometimes a latte is served in a bowl; in Europe, particularly Scandinavia, this is referred to as a café au
            lait.</li>
        <li>Increasingly common in the United States and Europe, latte art has led to the stylization of coffee making,
            and the creation of which is now a popular art form. Created by pouring steaming, and mostly frothed, milk
            into the coffee, that liquid is introduced into the beverage in such a way that patterns are distinguishable
            on the top of coffee. Popular patterns can include hearts, flowers, trees, and other forms of simplistic
            representations of images and objects.</li>
        <li>Often iced latte is served unstirred, so that coffee appears to "float" on top of white milk in a glass cup.
        </li>
        <li>A Layered Latte reverses the traditional order of creating a Latte. Rather than pouring steamed milk into a
            shot of espresso, pouring hot espresso into a glass of steamed milk will create a combination of temperature
            and density that will cause the latte to split into multiple density layers. The science behind the Layered
            Latte is referred to as double-diffusive convection. To make the Layered Latte, pour a shot of espresso into
            a glass of steamed milk at the same temperature. The layering of the beverage is largely dependent on
            variables such as glass size as well as the ratio between milk and espresso.</li>
        <li>A variation of the iced latte, known as the "bootleg latte", "ghetto latte", or "poor man's latte", is
            an iced espresso ordered in a larger than normal cup that will be filled up with free milk from the
            condiment station. The beverage has spawned debate at coffee shops where an iced espresso is
            considerably cheaper than an iced latte.</li>
        <li> In South Asia, East Asia, and North America, local variants of teas have been combined with steamed or
            frothed milk to create "tea latte". Coffee and tea shops now offer hot or iced latte versions of masala
            chai, matcha, and Royal Milk Tea. An Earl Grey latte is known as a "London fog".</li>
        <li>Other flavorings may be added to the latte to suit the taste of the drinker. Vanilla, chocolate, and caramel
            are all popular variants.</li>
        <li>In South Africa a red latte is made with rooibos tea and has been known as a caffeine-free alternative to
            traditional tea or coffee-based latte.</li>
        <li>An alternative version of latte may be prepared with soy milk or oat milk, as both have the ability to foam
            in the same way as cow milk, with soy milk versions being more prevalent. Such alternatives are popular
            among people with lactose intolerance and vegans.</li>
        <li>The Sea Salt Latte, a famous variation of the traditional style latte made with a salted milk foam over an
            espresso-based coffee, was invented and popularized by Taiwanese international cafe chain 85C Bakery
            Cafe.</li>

    <h2>Politics</h2>
    <p>Calling people "latte drinkers" pejoratively has become a common political attack in some Western cultures.
        The popularity of espresso drinking in large cities, especially among more affluent urban populations, has
        caused some to consider it elitist behavior. In the United States, conservative political commentators have
        been known to call their opponents "latte-drinking liberal elites". In Canadian politics,
        latte drinking is used to portray people as out-of-touch intellectuals and the antithesis of the Tim Hortons
        coffee drinker who is considered representative of an ordinary Canadian.</p>

    <p>According to a 2018 study, 16% of liberals in the United States prefer lattes, whereas 9% of conservatives
        and 11% of moderates do. The study states further that the overwhelming majority of people, whether they
        are liberal, conservative, or moderate, express a preference for regular brewed coffee.</p>
