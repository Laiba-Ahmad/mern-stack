    <h1 #top>Detroit-style pizza</h1>
    <p>Detroit-style pizza is a rectangular pan pizza with a thick, crisp, chewy crust. It is traditionally topped to
        the edges with Wisconsin brick cheese, which caramelizes against the high-sided heavyweight rectangular pan.
        Detroit-style pizza was originally baked in rectangular steel trays designed for use as automotive drip pans or
        to hold small industrial parts in factories. It was developed during the mid-20th century in Detroit,
        Michigan, before spreading to other parts of the United States in the 2010s. It is one of Detroit's iconic local
        foods</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Detroit-style pizza was developed in 1946 at Buddy's Rendezvous, a former speakeasy owned by Gus and Anna Guerra
        located at the corner of Six Mile Road and Conant Street in Detroit. Sources disagree whether the
        original Sicilian-style recipe was based on Anna Guerra's mother's recipe for sfincione or a recipe from one
        of the restaurant's employees, a Sicilian woman named Connie Piccinato. According to Robert Jacobs,
        current owner of Buddy’s, Piccanato instructed Guerra that "pressing the pepperoni into the dough would maximize
        the flavor penetration of the pepperoni". The recipe created a "focaccia-like crust" and the restaurant
        baked it in blue steel pans available from local automotive suppliers because baking pans available at the time
        were not appropriate for the dish. The steel pans were made by Dover Parkersburg in the 1930s and
        1940s and were originally used as drip trays or to hold small parts or scrap metal in automobile factories.
        Some 50- to 75-year-old pans are still in use.</p>

    <p> The restaurant was later renamed Buddy's Pizza. In 1953, the Guerras sold it and opened the Cloverleaf in
        Eastpointe, Michigan. Former Buddy's employee Louis Tourtois made pizzas at Shield's before founding
        Loui's Pizza in Hazel Park, Michigan. The Detroit News called Tourtois the "king of pizzas" in 1978.
        National chain Jet's, local chain Shield's, and Luigi's the Original of Harrison Township are other
        locally-notable restaurants serving the style.</p>

    <p> Buddy's Pizza chief brand officer Wesley Pikula, who started at Buddy's as a busboy in the 1980s, said that he
        had never heard the term "Detroit-style" before the 1980s when a trade magazine used it and that even afterward
        it was seldom used except in national trade articles. As late as 2007, some local media were referring to the
        style as "Sicilian-style". Some makers of Detroit-style pizza in other areas questioned whether to call
        their pizza by that name, as "sometimes people have negative thoughts about Detroit.</p>

    <p> The Detroit-style pizza was popular throughout the Detroit area but until the 2010s was not often found at
        restaurants outside the area. In 2011 two Detroit brothers opened a Detroit-style pizza restaurant in
        Austin, Texas, using the "Detroit-style" name as a point of differentiation. In 2012, a New York restaurateur
        created a pizza he called "Detroit-style", though he had never visited Detroit, using focaccia dough,
        mozzarella, and ricotta.</p>
    <p>In 2012, local restaurant cook Shawn Randazzo won the Las Vegas International Pizza Expo world championship with
        a Detroit-style pizza, and according to pizza educator Tony Gemignani, the reaction was immediate. "After he
        won, I must have had six phone calls from operators, from guys who are big in the industry, saying, 'Give me a
        recipe for Detroit. How do I figure this out?'"</p>

    <p> According to Serious Eats, "in early 2016 or so, everyone seemed to be talking about it or writing about it
        or
        opening up restaurants devoted to it." Trade journal Pizza Today wrote in 2018 that "Perhaps no pizza style
        has entered the public consciousness in quite the way that Detroit-style pan pizza has." Trade journal
        Restaurant Hospitality said the style had become popular on Instagram.</p>

    <p> In 2019, Esquire called the style "one of the hottest food trends across America", and both the
        Detroit
        Free Press and Eater said Detroit-style pizza was "having its moment". Eater wrote that pizzerias
        offering the style were spreading across the US, but that the new pizzas were different:</p>

    <p> On one side are the local Detroit pizzerias and restaurants devoted to their normcore, family-restaurant
        roots
        with toppings directly on the crust, a layer of processed brick cheese, and sauce on top. Then there are the
        "artisanal" square pizzas, with their aged doughs, organic toppings, unprocessed cheeses, and "frico" crust.
        These designer square slices are sometimes baked in a wood-fired oven and often served on Instagrammable metal
        trays in perfect lighting—a departure from the checkered tablecloths, no-frills boat drinks, and generous
        displays of bocce ball plaques at Buddy's. And in this new era of Detroit-style pizza, it's this photogenic
        version that many Americans are discovering first.</p>
    <p>Eater said the artisanal trend was slow to catch on in Detroit. Along with the Coney Island hot dog and the
        Boston cooler, the traditional Detroit-style is one of Detroit's iconic local foods.</p>

    <p> According to a 2021 forecast report, Yelp.com noted that Detroit-style pizza was national and reported that
        reviews mentioning "Detroit-style pizza" were up 52%.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Detroit-style pizza is a deep-dish rectangular pizza topped with Wisconsin brick cheese and a cooked tomato-based
        sauce. The dough typically has a hydration level of 70 percent or higher, which creates an open, porous,
        chewy crust with a crisp exterior. The fresh dough is double-proofed and stretched by hand to the
        pan corners. When seasoning new steel pans, they usually need to be dry-baked using 10 to 18 ounces of dough
        per pan. Randazzo says that the crust should be about 1.5 inches thick for true Detroit-style pizza. The
        buttery flavor of the crust results from a small quantity of oil and the melting properties of the mozzarella
        and Wisconsin brick cheeses. Shield's Pizza describes the importance of the sauce for flavor and how quality
        is ensured by consistently baking pizza for 13 minutes at 440 °F. Loui's Pizza places the pepperoni first,
        underneath almost one pound of brick cheese and then bakes the pizza at 700 °F. The brick cheese can
        withstand the heat due to the heavy butterfat content.</p>

    <p> Pepperoni is often placed directly on the crust, and other toppings may go directly on top of the cheese with
        the cooked sauce optionally as the final layer, applied in dollops or in "racing stripes", two or three
        lines of sauce.] Some recipes call for the sauce to be added after the pizza comes out of the
        oven. The style is sometimes referred to as "red top" because the sauce is the final topping.</p>
    <p>
        The cheese is spread to the edges and caramelizes against the high-sided heavyweight rectangular pan, giving the
        crust a lacy, crispy edge. This edge, known as frico, is the crispy caramelized cheese that runs along
        the edges of Detroit-style pizzas. According to the trade journal Pizza Today, "The key to this pizza is
        the delicious caramelized cheese that melts down the interior walls of the pan".</p>

    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <p>GQ food critic Alan Richman included Buddy's Pizza and Luigi's the Original among his 2009 list of 25 best pizzas
        in the USA. A Detroit-style pizza made by Randazzo, who was then working at Cloverleaf, won the 2012 Las
        Vegas International Pizza Expo world championship. The Chicago Tribune reviewed Jet's Pizza in 2013 and rated
        it very highly.[31] In 2019, The Daily Meal named Buddy's the best pizza in Michigan.[32] The Detroit Free Press
        named the Cloverleaf its Classic Restaurant of 2020. In 2016, the New York Post called it "the new hipster
        horror".

        In 2020, four Detroit-area restaurants, Buddy's, Supino Pizzeria, Loui's Pizza, and Cloverleaf Pizza, were
        listed in the 101 Best Pizzas in America by The Daily Meal. SmartBrief mentions that "Detroit-style pizza
        has been popping up on more menus over the past few years, and the hearty square pies have proven especially
        popular in the pandemic era". The Palm Beach Post describes how within minutes, a Delray Beach, Florida
        bakery with a Detroit-style pizza pop-up store sells out its takeout pizza that is ordered online at noon on a
        Monday for pickup on the following Sunday. A writer for Delish originally from Chicago and now based in New
        York City provided a positive review in an article correspondingly entitled "What Is Detroit-Style Pizza? It's
        Way Better Than Your Deep Dish Or New York Slice".</p>
