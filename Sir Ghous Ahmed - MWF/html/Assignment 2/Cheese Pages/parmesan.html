    <h1 #top>Parmesan</h1>
    <p>Parmesan (Italian: Parmigiano Reggiano; Italian pronunciation: [parmiˈdʒaːno redˈdʒaːno]) is an Italian hard,
        granular cheese produced from cows' milk and aged at least 12 months.</p>


    <p> Parmigiano Reggiano
        It is named after two of the areas which produce it, the provinces of Parma and Reggio Emilia (Parmigiano is the
        Italian adjective for Parma and Reggiano that for Reggio Emilia). In addition to Reggio Emilia and Parma, it is
        also produced in the part of Bologna west of the River Reno and in Modena (all of the above being located in the
        Emilia-Romagna region), as well as in the part of Mantua (Lombardy) which is on the south bank of the River Po.
    </p>

    <p> Both Parmigiano Reggiano and Parmesan are protected designations of origin (PDO) for cheeses produced in these
        provinces under Italian and European law. Outside the EU, the name "Parmesan" can legally be used for similar
        cheeses, with only the full Italian name unambiguously referring to PDO Parmigiano Reggiano.</p>

    <p> It has been called the "King of Cheeses" and "practically perfect food", whilst in 2023, the guide
        TasteAtlas has picked Parmigiano Reggiano as best cheese in the world.</p>

    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p>Parmigiano Reggiano is commonly grated over pasta dishes, stirred into soups and risottos, and eaten on its own.
        It is often shaved or grated over other dishes like salads.</p>

    <p> Half a wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese served on a table.
        Half a wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese carved with a Parmesan knife and communal fork
        Slivers and chunks of the hardest parts of the crust (also called the rind) are sometimes simmered in soups,
        broths, and sauces to add flavour. They can also be broiled and eaten as a snack if they have no wax on them.
        They can also be infused in olive oil or used in a steamer basket while steaming vegetables.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>According to legend, Parmigiano Reggiano was created in the course of the Middle Ages in Bibbiano, in the
        province of Reggio Emilia. Its production soon spread to the Parma and Modena areas. Historical documents show
        that in the 13th and 14th centuries, Parmigiano was already very similar to that produced today, which suggests
        its origins can be traced to far earlier. Some evidence suggests that the name was used for Parmesan cheese in
        Italy and France in the 17th-19th century.</p>

    <p> It was praised as early as 1348 in the writings of Boccaccio; in the Decameron, he invents a 'mountain, all of
        grated Parmesan cheese', on which 'dwell folk that do nought else but make macaroni and ravioli, and boil them
        in capon's broth, and then throw them down to be scrambled for; and hard by flows a rivulet of Vernaccia, the
        best that ever was drunk, and never a drop of water therein'.</p>

    <p> During the Great Fire of London of 1666, Samuel Pepys buried his "Parmazan cheese, as well as his wine and some
        other things" to preserve them.</p>

    <p> In the memoirs of Giacomo Casanova, he remarked that the name "Parmesan" was a misnomer common throughout an
        "ungrateful" Europe in his time (mid-18th century), as the cheese was produced in the town of Lodi, Lombardy,
        not Parma. Though Casanova knew his table and claimed in his memoir to have been compiling a (never completed)
        dictionary of cheeses, his comment has been taken to refer mistakenly to a grana cheese similar to Parmigiano,
        Grana Padano, which is produced in the Lodi area.[citation needed]</p>

    <p> Parmigiano Reggiano has been the target of organized crime in Italy, particularly the Mafia or Camorra, which
        ambush delivery trucks on the Autostrada A1, in northern Italy, between Milan and Bologna, hijacking shipments.
        The cheese is ultimately sold in southern Italy. Between November 2013 and January 2015, an organised crime
        gang stole 2039 wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano from warehouses in northern and central Italy.</p>

    <p> October 27 is designated "Parmigiano Reggiano Day" by The Consortium of Parmigiano Reggiano. This day
        celebrating the "King of Cheese" originated in response to the two earthquakes hitting the area of origin in May
        2012. The devastation was profound, displacing tens of thousands of residents, collapsing factories, and
        damaging historical churches, bell towers, and other landmarks. Years of cheese production were lost during
        the disaster, about $50 million worth. In order to assist the cheese producers, Modena native chef Massimo
        Bottura created the recipe riso cacio e pepe. He invited the world to cook this new dish along with him
        launching "Parmigiano Reggiano Day" – October 27.</p>
