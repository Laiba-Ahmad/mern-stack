    <h1 #top>Cola</h1>
    <p>Cola is a carbonated soft drink flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, citrus oils, and other flavorings. Cola became
        popular worldwide after the American pharmacist John Stith Pemberton invented Coca-Cola, a trademarked brand, in
        1886, which was imitated by other manufacturers. Most colas originally contained caffeine from the kola nut,
        leading to the drink's name, though other sources have since been used. The Pemberton cola drink also contained
        a coca plant extract. His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani,
        created in 1863.</p>

    <p> Most modern colas have a dark caramel color and are sweetened with sugar and/or high-fructose corn syrup. They
        come in numerous different brands, with Coca-Cola and Pepsi being among the most popular. These two companies
        have been competing since the 1890s, a rivalry that has intensified since the 1980s.</p>

    <h2>Flavorings</h2>
    <p>The primary modern flavorings in a cola drink are citrus oils (from orange, lime, and lemon peels), cinnamon,
        vanilla, and an acidic flavorant. Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace flavorings to create distinctive
        tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include a wide variety of ingredients, such as spices like nutmeg or
        coriander. Acidity is often provided by phosphoric acid, sometimes accompanied by citric or other isolated
        acids. Coca-Cola's recipe is maintained as a corporate trade secret.</p>

    <p> A variety of different sweeteners may be used in cola, often influenced by local agricultural policy.
        High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of
        government-subsidized corn. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the
        production of sugar; sugar is thus preferentially used to sweeten sodas. In addition, stevia or an
        artificial sweetener may be used; "sugar-free" or "diet" colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only.</p>

    <p> In Japan, there is a burgeoning craft cola industry, with small-scale local production methods and highly unique
        cola recipes using locally-sourced fruits, herbs, and spices.</p>

    <h2>Clear cola</h2>
    <p>In the 1940s, Coca-Cola produced White Coke at the request of Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov.</p>

    <p> Clear colas were again produced during the clear craze of the early 1990s. Brands included Crystal Pepsi, Tab
        Clear, and 7 Up Ice Cola. Crystal Pepsi has been repeatedly reintroduced in the 2010s.</p>

    <p> In Denmark, a popular clear cola was made by the Cooperative FDB in 1976. It was especially known for being the
        "Hippie Cola" because of the focus on the harmful effects the color additive could have on children and the
        boycott of multinational brands. It was inspired by a campaign on harmful additives in Denmark by the
        Environmental-Organisation NOAH, an independent Danish division of Friends of the Earth. This was followed up
        with a variety of sodas without artificial coloring.[14] Today many organic colas are available in Denmark, but,
        for nostalgic reasons, clear cola has still maintained its popularity to a certain degree.</p>

    <p> In June 2018, Coca-Cola introduced Coca-Cola Clear in Japan.</p>

    <h2>Health effects</h2>
    <p>A 2007 study found that consumption of colas, both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial
        sweetening, was associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The phosphoric acid used in colas
        was thought to be a possible cause.</p>

    <p> One 2005 study indicated soda and sweetened drinks are the main source of calories in the American diet and that
        of those who drink more sweetened drinks, obesity rates were higher. Most nutritionists advise that
        Coca-Cola and other soft drinks can be harmful if consumed excessively, particularly to young children whose
        soft drink consumption competes with, rather than complements, a balanced diet. Studies have shown that regular
        soft drink users have a lower intake of calcium, magnesium, vitamin C, riboflavin, and vitamin A.</p>

    <p> The drink has also aroused criticism for its use of caffeine, which can cause physical dependence (caffeine
        dependence), and can reduce sleep quality. A link has been shown between long-term regular cola intake
        and osteoporosis in older women (but not men). This was thought to be due to the presence of phosphoric
        acid, and the risk for women was found to be greater for sugared and caffeinated colas than diet and
        decaffeinated variants, with a higher intake of cola correlating with lower bone density.</p>

    <p> Many soft drinks in North America are sweetened mostly or entirely with high-fructose corn syrup, rather than
        sugar. Some nutritionists caution against the consumption of corn syrup because it may aggravate obesity and
        type-2 diabetes more than cane sugar.</p>
