    <h1 #top>Gruyère cheese</h1>
    <p>Gruyère (UK: /ˈɡruːjɛər/, US: /ɡruːˈjɛər, ɡriˈ-/, French: [ɡʁɥijɛʁ] (listen); German: Greyerzer) is a hard Swiss
        cheese that originated in the cantons of Fribourg, Vaud, Neuchâtel, Jura, and Berne in Switzerland. It is named
        after the town of Gruyères in Fribourg. In 2001, Gruyère gained the appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC), which
        became the appellation d'origine protégée (AOP) as of 2013.</p>

    <p> Gruyère is classified as a Swiss-type or Alpine cheese and is sweet but slightly salty, with a flavour that
        varies widely with age. It is often described as creamy and nutty when young, becoming more assertive, earthy,
        and complex as it matures. When fully aged (five months to a year), it tends to have small cracks that impart a
        slightly grainy texture. Unlike Emmental, with which it is often confused, modern Gruyère has few if any
        eyes, although in the 19th century, this was not always the case.[further explanation needed] It is the most
        popular Swiss cheese in Switzerland, and in most of Europe.</p>

    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p>Gruyère is used in many ways in countless dishes. It is considered a good cheese for baking, because of its
        distinctive but not overpowering taste. For example in quiche, Gruyère adds savoriness without overshadowing the
        other ingredients. It is a good melting cheese, particularly suited for fondues, along with Vacherin
        Fribourgeois and Emmental. It is also traditionally used in French onion soup, as well as in croque-monsieur, a
        classic French toasted ham and cheese sandwich. Gruyère is also used in chicken and veal cordon bleu. It is a
        fine table cheese, and when grated, it is often used with salads and pastas. It is used, grated, atop le tourin,
        a garlic soup from France served on dried bread. White wines, such as Riesling, pair well with Gruyère.
        Sparkling cider and Bock beer are also beverage affinities.[citation needed]</p>

    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>To make Gruyère, raw cow's milk is heated to 34 °C (93 °F) in a copper vat, and then curdled by the addition of
        liquid rennet. The curd is cut up into pea-sized pieces and stirred, releasing whey. The curd is cooked at 43 °C
        (109 °F), and raised quickly to 54 °C (129 °F).</p>

    <p>The whey is strained, and the curds placed into moulds to be pressed. After salting in brine and smearing with
        bacteria, the cheese is ripened for two months at room temperature, generally on wooden boards, turning every
        couple of days to ensure even moisture distribution. Gruyère can be cured for 3 to 10 months, with long curing
        producing a cheese of intense flavour.</p>

    <p> Sérac, a whey cheese, is a historical by-product of the manufacture of Gruyère.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Affinage</h2>
    <p>An important and the longest part of the production of Gruyère in Switzerland is the affinage (French for
        'maturation').</p>

    <p> According to the AOC, the cellars to mature a Swiss Gruyère must have a climate close to a natural cave. This
        means that the humidity should be between 94% and 98%. If the humidity is lower, the cheese dries out. If the
        humidity is too high, the cheese does not mature and becomes smeary and gluey. The temperature of the caves
        should be between 13 and 14 °C (55 and 57 °F). This relatively high temperature is required for
        excellent-quality cheese. Lower-quality cheeses result from temperatures between 10 and 12 °C (50 and 54 °F).
        The lower the temperature, the less the cheese matures, resulting in a harder and more crumbly texture.</p>
