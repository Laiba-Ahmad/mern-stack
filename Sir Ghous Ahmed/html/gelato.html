    <h1 #top>Gelato</h1>
    <p>Gelato (Italian pronunciation: [dʒeˈlaːto]; lit. 'frozen') is the common word in Italian for all kinds of ice
        cream. In English, it specifically refers to a frozen dessert of Italian origin. Artisanal gelato in Italy
        generally contains 6%–9% butterfat, which is lower than other styles of frozen dessert. Gelato typically
        contains 35% air (substantially less than American-style ice cream) and more flavoring than other kinds of
        frozen desserts, giving it a density and richness that distinguishes it from other ice creams.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>In 1295, Marco Polo returned to Venice from China with a recipe similar to sorbet.</p>

    <p> Cosimo Ruggeri, Bernardo Buontalenti, and Catherine de' Medici were 16th-century contemporaries who are
        variously credited with the invention and spread of gelato.</p>
    <p> In Florence, Cosimo Ruggeri is credited with creating the first gelato, fior di latte, at the court of Catherine
        de' Medici, in a competition, with the theme "il piatto più singolare che si fosse mai visto" (the most unique
        dish that had ever been seen).</p>

    <p> In the 1530s, Catherine de' Medici took gelato to Paris.</p>

    <p> Circa 1565, Bernardo Buontalenti, an innovator in ice conservation, made a sorbet with ice, salt, lemon, wine,
        milk, sugar, egg, and honey, "plus orange and bergamot flavouring". Buontalenti is credited with
        inventing gelato alla crema, whipped cream or egg cream gelato, the precursor to modern
        Florentine gelato.</p>
    <p> In 1686, Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli, a Sicilian,[34] brought his grandfather Francesco's[35]
        gelato-making machine to Paris, opened Café Procope and introduced the dessert.[36] Procopio obtained French
        citizenship, and a royal license from Louis XIV, making him the sole producer of the frozen dessert in the
        kingdom.</p>

    <p> In 1904, in America, Emery Thompson built the first automated ice cream machine.</p>

    <p> In 1945, in Bologna, Bruto Carpigiani began selling gelato-making equipment, and created Motogelatiera,
        the first automated gelato machine. The batch freezer made it easier to store frozen desserts.
        Carpigiani is a big manufacturer of gelato machinery.</p>
