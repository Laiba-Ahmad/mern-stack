    <h1 #top>Mineral water</h1>
    <P>Mineral water is water from a mineral spring that contains various minerals, such as salts and sulfur compounds.
        Mineral water may usually be still or sparkling (carbonated/effervescent) according to the presence or absence
        of added gases.</P>

    <P> Traditionally, mineral waters were used or consumed at their spring sources, often referred to as "taking the
        waters" or "taking the cure", at places such as spas, baths, or wells. The term spa was used for a place where
        the water was consumed and bathed in; bath where the water was used primarily for bathing, therapeutics, or
        recreation; and well where the water was to be consumed.</P>

    <P> Today, it is far more common for mineral water to be bottled at the source for distributed consumption.
        Travelling to the mineral water site for direct access to the water is now uncommon, and in many cases not
        possible because of exclusive commercial ownership rights. There are more than 4,000 brands of mineral water
        commercially available worldwide.</P>

    <P> In many places the term "mineral water" is colloquially used to mean any bottled carbonated water or soda water,
        as opposed to tap water.</P>

    <h2>Composition</h2>
    <p>The more calcium and magnesium ions that are dissolved in water, the harder it is said to be; water with few
        dissolved calcium and magnesium ions is described as being soft.</p>

    <p> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration classifies mineral water as water containing at least 250 parts per
        million total dissolved solids (TDS), originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water
        source. No minerals may be added to this water.</p>

    <p></p> In the European Union, bottled water may be called mineral water when it is bottled at the source and has
    undergone no or minimal treatment. Permitted is the removal of iron, manganese, sulfur and arsenic through
    decantation, filtration or treatment with ozone-enriched air, insofar as this treatment does not alter the
    composition of the water as regards to the essential constituents which give it its properties. No additions are
    permitted except for carbon dioxide, which may be added, removed or re-introduced by exclusively physical
    methods. No disinfection treatment is permitted, nor is the addition of any bacteriostatic agents.[citation
