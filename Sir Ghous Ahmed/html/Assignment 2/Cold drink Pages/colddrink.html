    <h1 #top>Cold Drinks</h1>
    <p>A soft drink (see ยง Terminology for other names) is any water-based flavored drink, usually but not necessarily
        carbonated, and typically including added sweetener. Flavors used can be natural and/or artificial. The
        sweetener may be a sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, a sugar substitute (in the case of diet
        drinks), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and/or
        other ingredients.</p>

    <p> Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks. Small amounts of alcohol may be present
        in a soft drink, but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink in many
        countries and localities if the drink is to be considered non-alcoholic. Types of soft drinks include
        lemon-lime drinks, orange soda, cola, grape soda, ginger ale, and root beer.</p>

    <p> Soft drinks may be served cold, over ice cubes, or at room temperature. They are available in many container
        formats, including cans, glass bottles, and plastic bottles. Containers come in a variety of sizes, ranging from
        small bottles to large multi-liter containers. Soft drinks are widely available at fast food restaurants, movie
        theaters, convenience stores, casual-dining restaurants, dedicated soda stores, vending machines, and bars from
        soda fountain machines.</p>

    <p> Within a decade of the invention of carbonated water by Joseph Priestley in 1767, inventors in Britain and in
        Europe had used his concept to produce the drink in greater quantities. One such inventor, J. J. Schweppe,
        formed Schweppes in 1783 and selling the world's first bottled soft drink.[4][5] Soft drink brands founded in
        the 19th century include R. White's Lemonade in 1845, Dr Pepper in 1885 and Coca-Cola in 1886. Subsequent brands
        include Pepsi, Irn-Bru, Sprite, Fanta, 7 Up and RC Cola.</p>

    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>Soft drinks are made by mixing dry or fresh ingredients with water. Production of soft drinks can be done at
        factories or at home. Soft drinks can be made at home by mixing a syrup or dry ingredients with carbonated
        water, or by Lacto-fermentation. Syrups are commercially sold by companies such as Soda-Club; dry ingredients
        are often sold in pouches, in a style of the popular U.S. drink mix Kool-Aid. Carbonated water is made using a
        soda siphon or a home carbonation system or by dropping dry ice into water. Food-grade carbon dioxide, used for
        carbonating drinks, often comes from ammonia plants.</p>

    <p> Drinks like ginger ale and root beer are often brewed using yeast to cause carbonation.</p>

    <p> Of most importance is that the ingredient meets the agreed specification on all major parameters. This is not
        only the functional parameter (in other words, the level of the major constituent), but the level of impurities,
        the microbiological status, and physical parameters such as color, particle size, etc.</p>

    <p> Some soft drinks contain measurable amounts of alcohol. In some older preparations, this resulted from natural
        fermentation used to build the carbonation. In the United States, soft drinks (as well as other products such as
        non-alcoholic beer) are allowed by law to contain up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. Modern drinks introduce carbon
        dioxide for carbonation, but there is some speculation that alcohol might result from fermentation of sugars in
        a non-sterile environment. A small amount of alcohol is introduced in some soft drinks where alcohol is used in
        the preparation of the flavoring extracts such as vanilla extract.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The origins of soft drinks lie in the development of fruit-flavored drinks. In the medieval Middle East, a
        variety of fruit-flavored soft drinks were widely drunk, such as sharbat, and were often sweetened with
        ingredients such as sugar, syrup and honey. Other common ingredients included lemon, apple, pomegranate,
        tamarind, jujube, sumac, musk, mint and ice. Middle Eastern drinks later became popular in medieval Europe,
        where the word "syrup" was derived from Arabic. In Tudor England, 'water imperial' was widely drunk; it was
        a sweetened drink with lemon flavor and containing cream of tartar. 'Manays Cryste' was a sweetened cordial
        flavored with rosewater, violets or cinnamon.</p>

    <p> Another early type of soft drink was lemonade, made of water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, but without
        carbonated water. The Compagnie des Limonadiers of Paris was granted a monopoly for the sale of lemonade soft
        drinks in 1676. Vendors carried tanks of lemonade on their backs and dispensed cups of the soft drink to
        Parisians.</p>
