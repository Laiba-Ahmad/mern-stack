    <h1 #top>Rice burger</h1>
    <p>A rice burger or riceburger is a variation on the traditional hamburger with compressed rice patties substituted
        for the hamburger buns. The MOS Burger fast-food restaurant chain introduced the rice burger in Japan
        1987, and since then it has become a popular food item in East Asia. Beginning around 2005 McDonald's also
        offered a rice burger in some of its Asian stores, with mixed results. In South Korea they are known as
        "bapburgers" (bap/bab means rice in Korean language). Popular Korean-style rice burgers include fillings such as
        Stir-fried kimchi and tuna with mayonnaise.</p>
