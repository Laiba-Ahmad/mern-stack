    <h1 #top>Brown Rice</h1>
    <p>Brown rice is a whole grain rice with the inedible outer hull removed. This kind of rice sheds its outer hull or
        husk but the bran and germ layer remain on, constituting the brown or tan colour of rice. White rice is the
        same grain without the hull, the bran layer, and the cereal germ. Red rice, gold rice, and black rice (also
        called purple rice) are all whole rices with differently pigmented outer layers.</p>

    <h2>Cooking time</h2>
    <p>Brown rice generally needs longer cooking times than white rice, unless it is broken or flour blasted (which
        perforates the bran without removing it).Studies by Gujral and Kumar in 2003 estimated a cooking time
        between 35 and 51 minutes.A shorter cooking time is necessary for "converted" or parboiled rice.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Brown rice has a shelf life of approximately 6 months,but hermetic storage, refrigeration or freezing can
        significantly extend its lifetime. Freezing, even periodically, can also help control infestations of Indian
        meal moths.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Arsenic</h2>
    <p>Rice plants accumulate arsenic, and there have been concerns over excessive arsenic levels in rice. There is more
        arsenic in the bran, so brown rice contains more arsenic. The European Union has introduced regulations on
        arsenic in rice,but the United States has not.</p>
    <p>Natural arsenic levels in groundwater and soils vary. Rice grown in some regions contains less arsenic than
        others. Arsenic from pesticides and poultry fertilizer may be taken up by rice.</p>
    <p>A 2012 report from the US publication Consumer Reports found measurable levels of arsenic in nearly all of the 60
        varieties of rice and rice products it tested in the US.Consumer Reports states that brown rice has 80
        percent more inorganic arsenic on average than white rice of the same type, because the arsenic tends to
        accumulate in the outer layers of the grain. Its 2013 analysis found that rice cereal and pasta can possess
        significantly more inorganic arsenic than the 2012 data showed; Consumer Reports said just one serving of rice
        cereal or pasta could place children over the maximum amount of rice it recommended for their weekly allotment,
        due to arsenic content.One study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal
        found a median level of arsenic that was 56% higher in the urine of women who had eaten rice.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional content</h2>
    <p>Brown rice and white rice have similar amounts of calories and carbohydrates. Between 72 and 82% of the dry
        weight of brown rice is starch, of which the majority is in the form of digestible starch. Brown rice
        therefore has the lowest protein and fiber content of cereal grains but the highest starch and carbohydrate
        content whilst its energy content is the second highest, after oats. Due to the low dietary fiber content there
        was a delay before the US FDA considered brown rice as a whole grain.</p>
    <p>Brown rice is a whole grain and a good source of magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, thiamine, niacin, vitamin B6,
        and manganese and does provide some fiber. White rice, unlike brown rice, has the bran and germ removed, and
        therefore has different nutritional content.</p>
    <p>Brown rice is whole rice from which only the husk (the outermost layer) is removed. To produce white rice, the
        next layers underneath the husk (the bran layer and the germ) are removed leaving mostly the starchy endosperm.
    </p>
    <p>Several vitamins and dietary minerals are lost in this removal and the subsequent polishing process. Among these
        are oil in the bran, which is removed along with the bran layer, dietary fiber, small amounts of fatty acids,
        and magnesium. A part of these missing nutrients, such as vitamins B1 and B3, and iron, are sometimes added back
        into the white rice. In the US the result is called "enriched rice" and must comply with Food and Drug
        Administration (FDA) regulations for this name to be used.</p>
    <p>It has been found that germinated grains in general have nutritional advantages. Germinated brown rice (GBR),
        developed during the International Year of Rice,[[[Germinated brown rice#{{{section}}}|contradictory]]] is brown
        rice that has been soaked for 4–20 hours in warm 40 °C (104 °F) water before cooking. This stimulates
        germination, which activates various enzymes in the rice, giving rise to a more complete amino acid profile,
        including GABA. Cooked brown rice tends to be chewy; cooked GBR is softer, and preferred particularly by
        children.</p>
    <p>Brown rice has numerous health benefits than white rice. Intaking white rice on a regular basis may lead to risk
        of type 2 diabetes, whereas, brown rice aids in weight loss, reduce cardiovascular risk and lots more.</p>
