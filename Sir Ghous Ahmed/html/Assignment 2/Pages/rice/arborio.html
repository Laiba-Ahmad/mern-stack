    <h1 #top>What Is Arborio Rice</h1>
    <p>Arborio rice is an Italian short-grain rice. It is named after the town of Arborio, in the Po Valley, which is
        situated in the region of Piedmont in Italy. When cooked, the rounded grains are firm, creamy and chewy compared
        to other varieties of rice, due to their higher amylopectin starch content.It has a starchy taste and blends
        well with other flavours. Arborio rice is often used to make risotto; other suitable varieties include
        Carnaroli, Maratelli, Baldo, and Vialone Nano. Arborio rice is also usually used for rice pudding.</p>
    <p>Arborio is a cultivar of the Japonica group of varieties of Oryza sativa.</p>
