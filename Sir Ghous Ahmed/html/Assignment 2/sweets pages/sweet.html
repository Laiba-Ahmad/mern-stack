    <h1 #top>Sweets</h1>
    <P>A dessert is typically the sweet course that, after the entr√©e and main course, concludes a meal in the culture
        of many countries, particularly Western culture. The course usually consists of sweet foods, but may include
        other items. The word "dessert" originated from the French word desservir "to clear the table" and the negative
        of the Latin word servire. There are a wide variety of desserts in western cultures, including cakes,
        cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, and candies. Fruit is also commonly found in
        dessert courses because of its natural sweetness. Many different cultures have their own variations of similar
        desserts around the world, such as in Russia, where many breakfast foods such as blini, oladyi, and syrniki can
        be served with honey and jam to make them popular as desserts.</P>
