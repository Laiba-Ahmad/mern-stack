    <h1 #top>Caffè mocha</h1>
    <P>A caffè mocha (Arabic: موكا) (/ˈmɒkə/ or /ˈmoʊkə/), also called mocaccino (Italian: [mokatˈtʃiːno]), is a
        chocolate-flavoured warm beverage that is a variant of a caffè latte (Italian: [kafˈfɛ lˈlatte]), commonly
        served in a glass rather than a mug. Other commonly used spellings are mochaccino and also mochachino. The
        name is derived from the city of Mokha, Yemen, which was one of the centres of early coffee trade.Like
        latte, the name is commonly shortened to just mocha.</P>

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>The name "mocha" is derived from the Yemeni port of Mokha, which was a port well-known for its coffee trade from
        the 15th to 17th century,and where small quantities of fine coffee grown in the hills nearby was
        exported. When coffee drinking culture spread to Europe, Europeans referred to coffee imports from Arabia as
        Mochas, even though coffee from Yemen itself was uncommon and frequently mixed with beans from Abyssinia, and
        later coffee from Malabar or the West Indies were also marketed as Mocha coffee.</p>
    <p>The drink nowadays called "mocha", however, has chocolate in it, and some believe that this is the result of
        confusion caused by the chocolatey tone that may sometimes be found in Yemeni coffee. Chocolate has been
        combined with coffee after chocolate drink was introduced to Italy in the 17th century; in Turin, chocolate was
        mixed with coffee and cream to produce bavareisa, which evolved in the 18th century into bicerin served in small
        clear glass where its components may be observed as three separate layers. However, prior to 1900s, Mocha
        referred to Yemeni coffee, and its meaning began to change around the turn of the 20th century, and recipes for
        food such as cakes that combined chocolate and coffee that referenced mocha began to appear. In 1920, a recipe
        for a "Chilled Mocha" was published with milk, coffee and cocoa as ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Like caffè latte, caffè mocha is based on espresso and hot milk but with added chocolate flavouring and
        sweetener, typically in the form of cocoa powder and sugar. Many varieties use chocolate syrup instead, and some
        may contain dark or milk chocolate.</p>
    <p>Caffè mocha, in its most basic formulation, can also be referred to as hot chocolate with (e.g., a shot of)
        espresso added. Like cappuccino, caffè mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top; as is common
        with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting
        of either cinnamon, sugar or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavour and
        decoration.</p>
    <p>A variant is white caffè mocha, made with white chocolate instead of milk or dark. There are also variants of
        the drink that mix the two syrups; this mixture is referred to by several names, including black-and-white
        mocha, marble mocha, tan mocha, tuxedo mocha, and zebra mocha.</p>
    <p>Another variant is a mochaccino which is an espresso shot (double) with either a combination of steamed milk and
        cocoa powder or chocolate milk. Both mochaccinos and caffè mocha can have chocolate syrup, whipped cream and
        added toppings such as cinnamon, nutmeg or chocolate sprinkles.</p>
    <p>A third variant on the caffè mocha is to use a coffee base instead of espresso. The combination would then be
        coffee, steamed milk, and the added chocolate. This is the same as a cup of coffee mixed with hot chocolate. The
        caffeine content of this variation would then be equivalent to the coffee choice included.</p>
    <p>The caffeine content is approximately 430 mg/L (12.7 mg/US fl oz), which is 152 mg for a 350 mL (12 US fl oz)
        glass.</p>
