    <h2 #top>Nitro cold brew</h2>
    <p>Nitro cold brew is a variation of cold brew coffee that uses the addition of nitrogen gas to create a smooth
        texture. It was created in the early 2010s.</p>

    <h2>Production
    </h2>
    <p>Production of nitro cold brew coffee begins with the making of cold brew coffee. Once the grounds are
        adequately steeped, the coffee is put into a room-temperature bottle or keg. As the cold brew is poured, it
        is charged with nitrogen to give it a rich, creamy head of foam, similar to draft beer. Though most beers and
        soft drinks are charged with carbon dioxide, nitrogen is occasionally used in darker stouts, resulting in a
        smoother finish. Nitro cold brew is typically served chilled, as ice would damage the foamy top.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Nitro cold brew was first offered at third wave coffee shops in the early 2010s, but the exact origin is
        disputed. The process is said by Men's Journal to have originated in 2013 at craft coffee houses Cuvee Coffee in
        Austin, Texas, and Stumptown in Portland, Oregon. However, Esquire gives credit to the draft coffee at The
        Queens Kickshaw in New York in 2011 as a predecessor. Cuvee Coffee first offered nitro cold brew, on tap, at
        the Slow Food Quiz Bowl in Austin, Texas, on August 14, 2012.[citation needed] The Ball Corporation issued a
        press release citing Cuvee as the first company to can cold brew in their widget cans, and BevNet awarded Cuvee
        the Best Packaging Innovation, calling them "the first cold brew brand to market a nitrogenated offering."
        Stumptown and Cuvee began offering canned beverages with a nitrogen disc, a hollow piece of plastic compressed
        with nitrogen in order to pressurize the can, by 2015. Starbucks introduced the beverage at 500
        stores in the summer of 2016, preceded in the Los Angeles market by The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. By
        2020, Starbucks offered the beverage at more than half of its locations across the United States, making it a
        staple menu item. Nitro cold brew is available from wholesalers in some markets in kegs. RISE Brewing Co.
        says it can fill up to 1,500 kegs a day of nitro cold brew coffee.</p>
