    <h1 #top>Chhena Cheese</h1>
    <p>Chhena (pronounced [ˈtʃʰeːna]) or chhana (Bengali pronunciation: [tʃʰana]) are a style of cheese, originating
        from the Indian subcontinent, made from water buffalo or regular cow milk by adding food acids such as
        lemon juice and calcium lactate instead of rennet and straining the whey through filtration.</p>

    <p> Chhena is pressed and may be further processed to make paneer, a form of farmer cheese, or formed into balls to
        make desserts such as khira sagara, chhena kheeri, rasabali and ras malai, as well as sweets from the Indian
        subcontinent (mitha or Misti or mithai) such as chhena jalebi, chhena gaja, chhena poda, pantua, rosogolla, and
        sandesh. For the sweets, mostly cow milk chhena is used.</p>

    <p> Chhena is produced in Bangladesh and eastern India, and it is generally made from cow or buffalo milk. In India,
        it is a legal requirement for Chhena to have no more than 70% of moisture content, and 50% of milk fat in dry
        material[4] The production of chhena in India was estimated to be 200,000 tonnes annually in 2009. Production is
        highest in the state of Uttar Pradesh, while consumption is highest in the state of West Bengal.</p>

    <p> Sahu and Das conducted a study of milk consumption in India and found that 6% of milk produced in India is
        used in the chhena production process. It is closely related to paneer cheese as they both share a similar
        production process, but it is kneaded when it is still warm in the manufacture process. The result is a cheese
        with a 'smooth, whipped-cream consistency', unlike paneer, which is firm.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Vedas religious texts, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, contain a reference to 'dadhanvat', which has been
        translated as referencing an 'abundance of curds'. Chitra Banerji states that in the myths of Krishna, a
        later manifestation of Vishnu, that there is reference to dairy products such as 'milk, butter, ghee and
        yogurt', but not to chhena. The Manasollasa, one of the medieval Indian cooking texts, was written during the
        reign of King Somesvara III in the 12th century. The Manasollasa details souring milk and draining the curds
        to make chhena and using them as a base for sweets. The text goes on to stipulate mixing the cheese with
        rice flour and shaping it into various balls, and then deep-frying to make sweets. Based on texts such as
        Charaka Samhita, BN Mathur wrote that the earliest evidence of a heat-acid coagulated milk product in India can
        be traced to 75-300 CE. Sunil Kumar et al. interpret this product as the present-day paneer or
        chhena.</p>

    <p> According to another theory, the Portuguese may have introduced the technique of "breaking" milk with acid to
        Bengal in the 17th century. Chhena was not widely made or utilised in India before the arrival of the Portuguese
        in 1517 in Bengal and Odisha, particularly as the curdling of cow's milk is taboo to the adherents of Hinduism
        and continues to this day. Prior to the arrival of the Portuguese in Bengal, sweets were made with khoa, or
        condensed milk which was solidified. Bengalis learnt how to prepare cheese for the Portuguese, which inspired
        chhena. Thus, according to this theory, Indian acid-set cheeses such as paneer and chhena were first
        prepared in Bengal, under Portuguese influence. Chhena cheese-based sweets were created by confectionery
        makers known as 'moria' in Bengal. The Halwai caste has long been associated with the production of chhena-based
        products. It is traditional for Bengalis to end a meal with a sweet, which is known as 'madhurena
        samapayet'. Today, some traditional sweet makers such as Annapurna Bhandar in New Delhi continue to make
        fresh chhena in their stores as a base for their products with locally sourced milk.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, chhena was largely produced in country milk sheds by farmers and sent by road and rail to
        manufacturers. Batch methods of production are utilised by smaller producers, with their methods and
        resulting products having different characteristics and flavours compared to commercially produced products.
        The most popular product produced with chhena is sandesh, a dessert. In recent times, chhena products have
        become a niche, competing with introduced foreign foods and desserts.</p>

    <p> Liberalisation, globalisation and privatisation are actively reshaping the Indian cheese industry.
        Traditional producers of chhena-based products are under pressure from foreign countries such as the United
        States of America seeking bilateral trade deals with the Indian government, especially as European-style cheeses
        such as mozzarella become more popular. Producers argue that they would not be able to compete with
        international dairy firms as they would have to comply with stricter sanitary and quarantine standards, which
        would vastly inflate costs of production. Dairy farmers in India are fiercely opposed to liberalisation of
        the dairy sector, as they fear job losses and the collapse of small industry which still produces traditional
        dairy products like chhena.</p>

    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>India's yearly production of Chhena is estimated to be 200,000 tonnes as of 2004. Traditionally, chhena is
        made in a Karahi, utilising a method similar to ricotta cheese production. The Food Safety and Standards
        Regulation of India states that Chhena is to be made from cow or buffalo milk, or a blend of both milks, and
        the coagulation can be completed with 'sour milk, or lactic or citric acid'. Aged acidic whey from previous
        batches can also be substituted in the coagulation process to prevent waste of ingredients and streamline the
        production process.

        The cheese is prepared by first boiling the chosen milk for 10 minutes, and then introducing an acid or aged
        acidic whey from a prior batch when the milk has slightly cooled at 75-80 degrees Celsius. Following this step,
        the whey separates and floats to the top of the pan. The whey is then removed by sieving the resulting curd, the
        chhena, through a muslin cloth. The pressing of the resulting curd mostly relies on gravity to separate it
        from the whey, but weighted boards can also be used to speed up the process. The longer the chhena is
        drained, the firmer the resulting final product becomes. Chhena is typically made in a small-scale batch
        process, but it is possible to make it with a continuous process like ricotta cheese in commercial production
        settings.</p>
    <p>In the case of sweet production, the cheese is drained, kneaded on a wooden board and mixed with sugar and a
        binding agent such as arrowroot or semolina flour. It is common now for machines to be used for the kneading
        process. The chhena is then rolled into balls ready for use in confectionary making.Some of these popular
        sweets and desserts that use Chhena as their base include rasogolla, sandesh, chum-chum, chhana murki, chhana
        podo, Ras malai, chhana balushahi, and khorma/belgrami. Chhena has also been blended with cream and made
        into a commercial refrigerated spreadable cheese. The chhena production process can be used to create a
        bioplastic which presents future innovation opportunities for the technology sector of India. However, this has
        raised ethical concerns domestically regarding food security for the wider population, as segments of the
        population struggle with rising food prices and malnutrition.</p>

    <p> Nutritious beverages can be created from the whey that is typically discarded in the production process of the
        Chhena by fermenting it with bacteria cultures "Streptococcus thermophilus NCDC-74 and Yoghurt culture
        YC-470". Lactic bacteria can ferment lactose into lactic acid, which means that people with dairy
        intolerances would be able to consume the beverages. The whey can also be used to make puras, otherwise
        known as pancakes. The whey must be of high quality and handled hygienically, otherwise the created products
        may have undesirable qualities and become not suitable for consumption. Three million tonnes of whey is
        produced each year in the chhena production process and it is typically dumped into the environment, where it is
        a substantial problem as a pollutant as it has a high amount of organic matter in its mass.</p>
