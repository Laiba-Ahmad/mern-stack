    <h1 #top>Pizza</h1>
    <p>Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin
        consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
        various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables,
        meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small
        pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>

    <p> In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and
        fork. In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>

    <p> The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of
        Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its
        variants have since become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, the
        Americas and Australasia, available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering
        Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food. Various food companies sell ready-baked
        pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven.</p>

    <p> In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000
        pizzerias. Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.</p>

    <p> The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization
        founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza. In 2009, upon
        Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed
        dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural
        heritage.</p>

    <p> Raffaele Esposito is often considered to be the father of modern pizza.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age. Records of people adding other ingredients to
        bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian
        soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on
        top of their battle shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and
        cheese. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the
        Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables
        (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped
        with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by
        Celaeno. The first mention of the word "pizza" comes from a notarial document written in Latin and dating to
        May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas
        Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day."</p>

    <p> Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.[30]
        Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is
        uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims, though it certainly could
        not have been before the 16th century and the Columbian Exchange. Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air
        stands and out of pizza bakeries.</p>

    <p> A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the
        Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a
        pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly
        preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag — red (tomato), green (basil), and white
        (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, although later research cast
        doubt on this legend. An official letter of recognition from the Queen's "head of service" remains on
        display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.</p>

    <p> Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared
        in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905.
        Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native
        cuisine, proved a ready market for pizza in particular.</p>

    <h2>Pizza cheese
    </h2>
    <p>Mozzarella cheese is commonly used on pizza, with the buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of
        Naples. Other cheeses are also used, particularly Italian cheeses including provolone, pecorino romano,
        ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market
        pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content,
        and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and
        experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins,
        and other changes in manufacture. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was 1 million
        metric tons (1,100,000 short tons) in the U.S. and 100,000 metric tons (110,000 short tons) in Europe.</p>
