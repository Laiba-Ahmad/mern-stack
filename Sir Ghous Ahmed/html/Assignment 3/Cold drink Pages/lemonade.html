    <h1 #top>Lemonade</h1>
    <p>There are varieties of lemonade found throughout the world. In North America and South Asia, cloudy still
        lemonade is the most common variety. There it is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a
        sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup or honey. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Central Europe, South
        Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, a carbonated lemonade soft drink is more common. Despite the differences
        between the drinks, each is known simply as "lemonade" in countries where it is dominant.</p>

    <p> The suffix "-ade" may also be applied to other similar drinks made with different fruits, such as limeade,
        orangeade, or cherryade.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>A drink made with lemons, dates, and honey was consumed in 13th and 14th century Egypt, including a lemon juice
        drink with sugar, known as qatarmizat. In 1676, a company known as Compagnie de Limonadiers sold lemonade in
        Paris. Vendors carried tanks of lemonade on their backs and dispensed cups of the soft drink to Parisians.</p>

    <p> While carbonated water was invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767 (with his pamphlet Directions for Impregnating
        Water with Fixed Air published in London in 1772), the first reference found to carbonated lemonade was in
        1833 when the drink was sold in British refreshment stalls. R. White's Lemonade has been sold in the UK since
        1845.</p>

    <h2>Health effects</h2>
    <p>The high concentration of citric acid in lemon juice is the basis for popular culture recommendations of
        consumption of lemonade to prevent calcium-based kidney stones. Studies have not demonstrated that lemonade
        causes a sustained improvement of urine pH, increased citric acid concentration in urine, reduction in
        supersaturation by stone-forming salts, or prevention of recurrent stones.</p>
