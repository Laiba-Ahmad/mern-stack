    <h1 #top>Cheeseburger</h1>
    <p>A cheeseburger is a hamburger with a slice of melted cheese on top of the meat patty, added near the end of the
        cooking time. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition. As with other
        hamburgers, a cheeseburger may include various condiments and other toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, avocado, mushrooms, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard.</p> 

    <p> In US fast food restaurants, processed cheese is usually used, although other meltable cheeses are used, such as
        cheddar, Swiss, mozzarella, blue cheese, or pepper jack. Restaurant chains that sell cheeseburgers include
        McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.</p>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>By the late 19th century, the vast grasslands of the Great Plains had been opened up for cattle ranching. This
        made it possible for many Americans to consume beef almost daily. The hamburger remains as one of the cheapest
        forms of beef in America.</p>

    <p> Adding cheese to hamburgers became popular in 1920. There are several competing claims as to who created the
        first cheeseburger. Lionel Sternberger is reputed to have introduced the cheeseburger in 1924 at the age of 16.
        He was working as a fry cook at his father's Pasadena, California sandwich shop, "The Rite Spot", and
        "experimentally dropped a slab of American cheese on a sizzling hamburger. An early example
        of the cheeseburger appearing on a menu is a 1928 menu for the Los Angeles restaurant O'Dell's which listed a
        cheeseburger smothered with chili for 25 cents.</p>
        
        <p> Other restaurants also claim to have invented the cheeseburger. For example, Kaelin's Restaurant in Louisville,
            Kentucky, said it invented the cheeseburger in 1934. One year later, a trademark for the name "cheeseburger"
            was awarded to Louis Ballast of the Humpty Dumpty Drive-In in Denver, Colorado. According to Steak 'n Shake
            archives, the restaurant's founder, Gus Belt, applied for a trademark on the word in the 1930s.</p>
            
            <p> An A&W Restaurants franchise in Lansing, Michigan is credited with inventing the bacon cheeseburger in 1963,
                putting it on the menu after repeated requests from the same customer.</p>
                
                <p> The steamed cheeseburger, a variation almost exclusively served in central Connecticut, is believed to have been
                    invented at a restaurant called Jack's Lunch in Middletown, Connecticut, in the 1930s.</p>
                    
                    <p> The largest cheeseburger ever made weighed 2,014 pounds (914 kg). It is said to have included "60 pounds (27 kg)
                        of bacon, 50 pounds (23 kg) of lettuce, 50 pounds (23 kg) of sliced onions, 40 pounds (18 kg) of pickles, and 40
                        pounds (18 kg) of cheese." This record was set in 2012 by Minnesota's Black Bear Casino, smashing the previous
                        record of 881 pounds (400 kg).</p>
                        
                        <p> In the United States, National Cheeseburger Day is celebrated annually on September 18.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The ingredients used to create cheeseburgers follow similar patterns found in the regional variations of
        hamburgers, although most start with ground beef. Common cheeses used for topping are American, Swiss, Cheddar
        and other meltable cheeses. Popular toppings include lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, avocado or
        guacamole, sliced sautéed mushrooms, cheese sauce or chili, but the variety of possible toppings is broad.</p>
        
        <p> A cheeseburger may have more than one patty or more than one slice of cheese—it is reasonably common, but by no
            means automatic, for the number to increase at the same rate with cheese and meat interleaved. A stack of two or
            more patties follows the same basic pattern as hamburgers: with two patties will be called a double
            cheeseburger; a triple cheeseburger has three, and while much less common, a quadruple has four.</p>
            
            <p> Sometimes cheeseburgers are prepared with the cheese enclosed within the ground beef, rather than on top. This
                is sometimes known as a Jucy Lucy.</p>
