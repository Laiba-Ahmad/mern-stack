    <h1>Soup</h1>
    <p>Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or cold), that is made by
        combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, milk, or water. Hot soups are additionally characterized
        by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth. Soups are
        similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, soups
        generally have more liquid (broth) than stews.</p>

    <p> In traditional French cuisine, soups are classified into two main groups: clear soups and thick soups. The
        established French classifications of clear soups are bouillon and consommé. Thick soups are classified
        depending upon the type of thickening agent used: purées are vegetable soups thickened with starch; bisques are
        made from puréed shellfish or vegetables thickened with cream; cream soups may be thickened with béchamel sauce;
        and veloutés are thickened with eggs, butter, and cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and
        broths include rice, lentils, flour, and grains; many popular soups also include pumpkin, carrots, potatoes,
        pig's trotters and bird's nests.</p>

    <p> Other types of soup include fruit soups, dessert soups, pulse soups like split pea, cold soups and other styles.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The earliest evidence for soup in human culinary practice dates to the Upper Palaeolithic period when thermally
        altered rocks became commonplace in the archaeological record.[3][4] Small boiling pits are present on the
        Gravettian site Pavlov VI.[5] Cobbles were heated on the hearth and then placed into the water to bring it to
        boil. However, the antiquity of soup is highly contested. Based on ethnographic evidence, some archaeologists
        conjecture that early humans employed hides and watertight baskets to boil water.[6]</p>

    <p> The word soup comes from French soupe ("soup", "broth"), which comes through Vulgar Latin suppa ("bread soaked
        in broth") from a Germanic source, from which also comes the word "sop", a piece of bread used to soak up soup
        or a thick stew.</p>

    <p> The word restaurant (meaning "[something] restoring") was first used in France in the 16th century, to refer to
        a highly concentrated, inexpensive soup, sold by street vendors, that was advertised as an antidote to physical
        exhaustion.[citation needed] In 1765, a Parisian entrepreneur opened a shop specializing in such soups. This
        prompted the use of the modern word restaurant to refer to eating establishments.[citation needed]</p>

    <p> In the US, the first colonial cookbook was published by William Parks in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1742, based
        on Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife; or Accomplished Gentlewoman's Companion, and it included several
        recipes for soups and bisques. A 1772 cookbook, The Frugal Housewife, contained an entire chapter on the topic.
        English cooking dominated early colonial cooking; but as new immigrants arrived from other countries, other
        national soups gained popularity. In particular, German immigrants living in Pennsylvania were famous for their
        potato soups. In 1794, Jean Baptiste Gilbert Payplat dis Julien, a refugee from the French Revolution, opened an
        eating establishment in Boston called "The Restorator", and became known as the "Prince of Soups". The first
        American cooking pamphlet dedicated to soup recipes was written in 1882 by Emma Ewing: Soups and Soup Making.

    <p> Portable soup was devised in the 18th century by boiling seasoned meat until a thick, resinous syrup was left
        that could be dried and stored for months at a time.[citation needed]</p>
