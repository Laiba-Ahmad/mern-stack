    <h1 #top>Pizza Margherita</h1>
    <p>Pizza Margherita (more commonly known in English as Margherita pizza) is a typical Neapolitan pizza, made with
        San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt, and extra-virgin olive oil.</p>

    <h2>Origin and history</h2>
    <p>In June 1889 the pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito, Pizzeria Brandi's chef, invented a dish called "pizza Margherita"
        in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, and Italian unification, since toppings are tomato (red),
        mozzarella (white), and basil (green), ingredients inspired by the colors of the national flag of Italy.</p>

    <p> The origins of pizza Margherita came from mixing similar toppings that were already present in Naples between
        1796 and 1810. In 1849 Emanuele Rocco recorded different pizza toppings including basil, tomatoes and thin
        slices of mozzarella; the mozzarella was thinly sliced, and added to the toppings already present.</p>

    <p> In 1866, Francesco De Bourcard, writing about the Naples traditions, described the most commonly used pizza
        toppings at that time as well as the possible origin of calzone:</p>

    <p> The most ordinary pizza, called coll'aglio e l'olio (with garlic and oil), is dressed with oil, and over it is
        spread, as well as salt, origanum and garlic cloves shredded minutely (optionally), often referred to as
        focaccia (depending on the region). Others can be covered in grated cheese and dressed with lard, and then they
        put on a few leaves of basil. Over the former is often added (depending on the region) some small seafish; on
        the latter some thin slices of mozzarella. Sometimes they use slices of prosciutto, tomato, arselle, etc.
        Sometimes folding the dough over itself to form what is called "calzone".</p>
