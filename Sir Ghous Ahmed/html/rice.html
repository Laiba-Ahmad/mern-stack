    <h1 id="top">What is Rice:</h1>
    <p>Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or less commonly O. glaberrima (African rice).
        The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia, both wild and domesticated,
        although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza.</p>

    <p>As a cereal grain, domesticated rice is the most widely consumed staple food for over half of the world's human
        population,[Liu 1] particularly in Asia and Africa. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest
        worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize.Since sizable portions of sugarcane and maize crops are used
        for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important food crop with regard to human nutrition
        and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans.There are
        many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally.</p>
    <p>The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings.
        This simple method requires sound irrigation planning, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest
        plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin. While flooding is not mandatory for the
        cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during
        growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.</p>

    <p>Rice, a monocot, is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial
        and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years.Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions
        with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However,
        rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling
        terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade
        and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide. Production and consumption of rice is
        estimated to have been responsible for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010.</p>

    <h2>History Of Rice:</h2>
    <p>The history of rice cultivation is an interdisciplinary subject that studies archaeological and documentary
        evidence to explain how rice was first domesticated and cultivated by humans, the spread of cultivation to
        different regions of the planet, and the technological changes that have impacted cultivation over time.</p>

    <p>The current scientific consensus, based on archaeological and linguistic evidence, is that Oryza sativa rice was
        first domesticated in the Yangtze River basin in China 13,500 to 8,200 years ago.Cultivation,
        migration and trade spread rice around the world - first to much of east Asia, and then further abroad, and
        eventually to the Americas as part of the Columbian exchange. The now less common Oryza glaberrima rice was
        independently domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago.Other wild rice species have also been
        cultivated in different geographies, such as in the Americas.</p>

    <p>Since its spread, rice has become a global staple crop important to food security and food cultures around the
        world. Local varieties of Oryza sativa have resulted in over 40,000 cultivars of various types. More recent
        changes in agricultural practices and breeding methods as part of the Green Revolution and other transfers of
        agricultural technologies has led to increased production in recent decades,with emergence of new types
        such as golden rice, which was genetically engineered to contain beta carotene.</p>

    <h2>Rice-growing environments:</h2>
    <p>Rice growth and production are affected by: the environment, soil properties, biotic conditions, and cultural
        practices. Environmental factors include rainfall and water, temperature, photoperiod, solar radiation and, in
        some instances, tropical storms. Soil factors refer to soil type and their position in uplands or lowlands.
        Biotic factors deal with weeds, insects, diseases, and crop varieties.</p>

    <p>Rice can be grown in different environments, depending upon water availability.Generally, rice does not
        thrive in a waterlogged area, yet it can survive and grow herein and it can survive flooding.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Lowland, rainfed, which is drought prone, favors medium depth; waterlogged, submergence, and flood prone
        </li>
        <li>Lowland, irrigated, grown in both the wet season and the dry season</li>
        <li>Deep water or floating rice</li>
        <li>Coastal wetland</li>
        <li>Upland rice (also known as hill rice or Ghaiya rice)</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    </hr>
    <h2>Characteristics:</h2>
    <p>The rice plant can grow to 1–1.8 m (3–6 ft) tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and soil fertility.
        It has long, slender leaves 50–100 cm (20–40 in) long and 2–2.5 cm (3⁄4–1 in) broad. The small wind-pollinated
        flowers are produced in a branched arching to pendulous inflorescence 30–50 cm (12–20 in) long. The edible seed
        is a grain (caryopsis) 5–12 mm (3⁄16–15⁄32 in) long and 2–3 mm (3⁄32–1⁄8 in) thick.</p>
    <p>Rice is a cereal crop belonging to the family Poecae. Rice being a tropical crop can be grown during the two
        distinct seasons (dry and wet) of the year provided that moisture is made available to the crop.</p>

    <h2>Food:</h2>
    <p>Rice is commonly consumed as food around the world.</p>
    <hr>
    </hr>
    <h2>Cooking:</h2>
    <p>The varieties of rice are typically classified as long-, medium-, and short-grained.The grains of long-grain
        rice (high in amylose) tend to remain intact after cooking; medium-grain rice (high in amylopectin) becomes more
        sticky. Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for risotto in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as arròs
        negre, in Spain. Some varieties of long-grain rice that are high in amylopectin, known as Thai Sticky rice, are
        usually steamed.A stickier short-grain rice is used for sushi;the stickiness allows rice to hold its
        shape when cooked.Short-grain rice is used extensively in Japan,including to accompany savoury
        dishes.Short-grain rice is often used for rice pudding.</p>
    <p>Instant rice differs from parboiled rice in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant
        degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and starch often are used in batters and breadings to increase
        crispiness.</p>
    <hr>
    </hr>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Rinsing rice before cooking removes much of the starch, thereby reducing the extent to which individual grains
        will stick together. This yields a fluffier rice, whereas not rinsing yields a stickier and creamier result.
        Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of
        nutrients.</p>
    <p>Rice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce
        stickiness. For some varieties, soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the
        grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.</p>
    <p>Brown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate germination. This process, called germinated
        brown rice (GBR),activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including gamma-aminobutyric acid to improve
        the nutritional value of brown rice. This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations
        International Year of Rice.</p>
    <p>Rice is cooked by boiling or steaming, and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be
        cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses.With the rapid-boil
        method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation
        is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded.
        Electric rice cookers, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any
        other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example saffron rice or risotto); this
        makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called pilaf in Iran and Afghanistan or
        biryani in India and Pakistan.</p>
    <hr>
    </hr>
    <h2>Dishes:</h2>
    <p>In Arab cuisine, rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It
        is used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves (dolma). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it
        is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as Tabaristan, bread is made using rice flour. Rice may be made
        into congee (also called rice porridge or rice gruel) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice
        is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a
        breakfast food, and is a traditional food for the sick.</p>
    <hr>
    </hr>
    <h2>Nutrition:</h2>
    <p>Rice is the staple food of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17
        countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa. Rice
        provides 20% of the world's dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.</p>
    <p>Cooked unenriched long-grain white rice is composed of 68% water, 28% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 1% fat
        (table). A 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference serving of it provides 540 kilojoules (130 kilocalories) of food
        energy and contains no micronutrients in significant amounts, with all less than 10% of the Daily Value (DV)
        (table). Cooked short-grain white rice provides the same food energy and contains moderate amounts of B
        vitamins, iron, and manganese (10–17% DV) per 100-gram serving (table).</p>
    <p>A detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a
        number of factors. It depends on the strain of rice, such as white, brown, red, and black (or purple) varieties
        having different prevalence across world regions.It also depends on nutrient quality of the soil rice is
        grown in, whether and how the rice is polished or processed, the manner it is enriched, and how it is prepared
        before consumption.</p>
    <p>A 2018 World Health Organization (WHO) guideline showed that fortification of rice to reduce malnutrition may
        involve different micronutrient strategies, including iron only, iron with zinc, vitamin A, and folic acid, or
        iron with other B-complex vitamins, such as thiamin, niacin, vitamin B6, and pantothenic acid.A systematic
        review of clinical research on the efficacy of rice fortification showed the strategy had the main effect of
        reducing the risk of iron deficiency by 35% and increasing blood levels of hemoglobin.The guideline
        established a major recommendation: "Fortification of rice with iron is recommended as a public health strategy
        to improve the iron status of populations, in settings where rice is a staple food."</p>
    <p>Rice grown experimentally under elevated carbon dioxide levels, similar to those predicted for the year 2100 as a
        result of human activity, had less iron, zinc, and protein, as well as lower levels of thiamin, riboflavin,
        folic acid, and pantothenic acid.The following table shows the nutrient content of rice and other major
        staple foods in a raw form on a dry weight basis to account for their different water contents.[18]</p>

    <h2>Price</h2>
    <p>In late 2007 to May 2008, the price of grains rose greatly due to droughts in major producing countries
        (particularly Australia), increased use of grains for animal feed and US subsidies for bio-fuel production.
        Although there was no shortage of rice on world markets this general upward trend in grain prices led to panic
        buying by consumers, government rice export bans (in particular, by Vietnam and India) and inflated import
        orders by the Philippines marketing board, the National Food Authority. This caused significant rises in rice
        prices. In late April 2008, prices hit 24 US cents a pound, twice the price of seven months earlier.Over
        the period of 2007 to 2013, the Chinese government has substantially increased the price it pays domestic
        farmers for their rice, rising to US$500 per metric ton by 2013.The 2013 price of rice originating from
        other southeast Asian countries was a comparably low US$350 per metric ton.</p>
    <p>On April 30, 2008, Thailand announced plans for the creation of the Organisation of Rice Exporting Countries
        (OREC) with the intention that this should develop into a price-fixing cartel for rice.However, as of
        mid-2011 little progress had been made to achieve this.</p>
