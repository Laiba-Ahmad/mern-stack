    <h1 #top>Heinz Tomato Ketchup</h1>
    <p>Heinz Tomato Ketchup is a brand of ketchup manufactured by the H. J. Heinz Company, a division of the Kraft Heinz
        Company.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p> 
        It was first marketed as "catsup" in 1876 In 1907, manufacturing reached 12 million bottles and it was
        exported internationally including Australia, South America, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK. In
        January 2009, the label was changed by replacing the picture of a gherkin pickle with a picture of a tomato.
        In 2012, there were more than 650 million bottles sold worldwide.</p>
    <hr> 
    <h2>Counterfeiting scheme</h2>
    <p>In 2012, an alleged scheme to repackage regular Heinz ketchup into bottles labelled with counterfeit "Simply
        Heinz" labels failed when the ketchup apparently began to ferment and the bottles exploded. At the time,
        according to a Heinz spokesman, they were working with the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal
        Investigation.</p>
    <hr> 
    <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
    <p>Heinz manufactures all of its tomato ketchup for their USA market at two plants: one in Fremont, Ohio, and the
        other in Muscatine, Iowa. They closed their Canadian plant in Leamington, Ontario in 2014. That plant is
        now owned by French's Food Company and manufactures French's Tomato Ketchup for the Canadian market.
        Globally, Heinz manufactures ketchup in factories across the world, including the UK and the Netherlands.
        Although there is one basic recipe for their ketchup, there are variations tailored to regional tastes, and
        usually depend on the country where it is manufactured.</p>
    <h3>Varieties</h3>
    <p>In addition to manufacturing their regular tomato ketchup, they manufacture a variety made with sugar.</p>

    <p></p> In 2000, they manufactured coloured ketchup in squeezable containers appreciated by young children. The
    colours were red, green, purple, pink, orange, teal, and blue. These varieties were discontinued in
    2006.</p>

    <p> In 2011 they also started manufacturing a variety with balsamic vinegar. This variety was discontinued in
        2018.</p>

    <p> On June 5, 2019, (which is National Ketchup Day), Heinz, and Ed Sheeran, released a limited-edition ketchup
        known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, popularly known as "Edchup".[citation needed]</p>
    <h3>Saucy Sauce product line</h3>
    <p>In April 2018, Heinz announced the release of "Mayochup", a portmanteau of mayonnaise + ketchup that is a mixture
        of the two sauces, because more than 500,000 users voted "yes" in a Twitter poll asking Americans if they
        wanted to see it in stores. A number of Twitter users responded that such a mixture already existed as "fry
        sauce" and "fancy sauce". The sauce arrived on US retailers' shelves in September 2018. It
        attracted some media attention in May 2019 when the phrase was revealed to mean "shit-face" in the Cree
        language. Mixtures containing mayonnaise and ketchup predate the release.</p>

    <p> In March 2019, after the success of their Mayochup campaign, Heinz announced the release of two new portmanteau
        products to celebrate the company's 150th anniversary: "Mayomust", from mayonnaise + mustard, and "Mayocue",
        from mayonnaise + barbecue sauce.</p>

        <p> In April 2019, they released "Kranch", combining ketchup + ranch dressing. The new sauce received a mixed
            reception online, with Newsweek saying that it "might seem as if Kranch is a flight of fancy from a
            drunken frat boy" but that some consumers were nevertheless interested.</p>
            
            <p> In January 2020, Heinz announced "Honeyracha" combining honey + sriracha,[28] then in February announced
                "Mayoracha" combining mayonnaise + sriracha.</p>
                
                <p> In March 2021, they released "Tarchup" combining tartar sauce + ketchup, "Wasabioli" combining wasabi +
                    aioli,
                    and "Hanch" combining hot sauce + ranch dressing. Later in March, two more sauces were announced with
                    "Buffaranch" combining Buffalo sauce + ranch dressing and "Sweet Ketchili" combining ketchup + sweet chili
                    sauce.</p>
                    <h3>Packaging</h3>
                    <p>Heinz ketchup is packaged in glass and plastic bottles of various sizes. They introduced their octagonal glass
                        bottle for the first time in 1889 and it was patented in 1890. While other glass bottle designs have existed,
                        the octagonal glass bottle is still in use and is considered to be an iconic example of package design.</p>
                        
                        <p> In restaurants, the glass bottle commonly used contains about 14 ounces (400 g) of ketchup. In 2002, the
                            upside-down, squeezable plastic bottle (an opaque red bottle with a wide white cap on the bottom) was introduced
                            for restaurants. It makes dispensing ketchup easier than from the glass bottle. The design also generates less
                            waste as the ketchup settles down to the dispensing valve. Similarly designed squeezable bottles, in several
                            different sizes, are available in grocery stores. It is also packaged as single serving packets made of foil
                            and/or plastic. In 2010, Heinz introduced Dip & Squeeze, a single serving packet designed for either dipping
                            or squeezing. A small bottle containing about 2.25 ounces (64 g) of ketchup is packaged for room service in
                            hotels or situations where single serving packets associated with fast-food restaurants is undesirable.</p>
                            
                            <p> Larger amounts, generally intended for the foodservice industry, are packaged in metal cans, rigid plastic
                                containers, flexible plastic bags and a bag-in-box format. These larger containers can usually be fitted with
                                pumps or placed into dispensers for self service in fast-food restaurants. A bag containing 3 US gallons (11 L)
                                is the largest format intended for restaurants. An IBC tote containing 260 US gallons (980 L) is sold to food
                                manufacturers.</p>
