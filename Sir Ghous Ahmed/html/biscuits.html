    <h1 #top>Biscuit</h1>
    <p>A biscuit is a flour-based baked and shaped food product. In most countries biscuits are typically hard, flat,
        and unleavened. They are usually sweet and may be made with sugar, chocolate, icing, jam, ginger, or cinnamon.
        They can also be savoury, similar to crackers. Types of biscuit include sandwich biscuits, digestive biscuits,
        ginger biscuits, shortbread biscuits, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate-coated marshmallow treats, Anzac
        biscuits, biscotti, and speculaas.

        In most of North America, nearly all hard sweet biscuits are called "cookies", while the term "biscuit" is used
        for a soft, leavened quick bread similar to a less sweet version of a scone.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Biscuits for travel</h3>
    <p>The need for nutritious, easy-to-store, easy-to-carry, and long-lasting foods on long journeys, in particular at
        sea, was initially solved by taking live food along with a butcher/cook. However, this took up additional space
        on what were either horse-powered treks or small ships, reducing the time of travel before additional food was
        required. This resulted in early armies' adopting the style of hunter-foraging.</p>

    <p> The introduction of the baking of processed cereals including the creation of flour provided a more reliable
        source of food. Egyptian sailors carried a flat, brittle loaf of millet bread called dhourra cake while the
        Romans had a biscuit called buccellum. Roman cookbook Apicius describes: "a thick paste of fine wheat flour
        was boiled and spread out on a plate. When it had dried and hardened, it was cut up and then fried until crisp,
        then served with honey and pepper."</p>
    <p> Many early physicians believed that most medicinal problems were associated with digestion. Hence, for both
        sustenance and avoidance of illness, a daily consumption of a biscuit was considered good for health.</p>

    <p> Hard biscuits soften as they age. To solve this problem, early bakers attempted to create the hardest biscuit
        possible. Because it is so hard and dry, if properly stored and transported, navies' hardtack will survive rough
        handling and high temperature. Baked hard, it can be kept without spoiling for years as long as it is kept dry.
        For long voyages, hardtack was baked four times, rather than the more common two. To soften hardtack for
        eating, it was often dunked in brine, coffee, or some other liquid or cooked into a skillet meal.</p>
    <p> The collection Sayings of the Desert Fathers mentions that Anthony the Great (who lived in the 4th century AD)
        ate biscuits and the text implies that it was a popular food among monks of the time and region.</p>
    <p> At the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588, the daily allowance on board a Royal Navy ship was one pound of
        biscuit plus one gallon of beer. Samuel Pepys in 1667 first regularised naval victualling with varied and
        nutritious rations. Royal Navy hardtack during Queen Victoria's reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence
        Victualling Yard at Gosport, Hampshire, stamped with the Queen's mark and the number of the oven in which they
        were baked. When machinery was introduced into the process the dough was thoroughly mixed and rolled into sheets
        about 2 yards (1.8 m) long and 1 yard (0.9 m) wide which were stamped in one stroke into about sixty
        hexagonal-shaped biscuits. This left the sheets sufficiently coherent to be placed in the oven in one piece and
        when baked they were easy to separate. The hexagonal shape rather than traditional circular biscuits meant a
        saving in material and was easier to pack.[14] Biscuits remained an important part of the Royal Navy sailor's
        diet until the introduction of canned foods. Canned meat was first marketed in 1814; preserved beef in tins was
        officially added to Royal Navy rations in 1847.</p>
