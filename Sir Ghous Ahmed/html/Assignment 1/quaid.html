    <h1>Quaid</h1>
    <p>The great leader and founder of Pakistan. <q>His real name is Mohammad Ali Jinnah but widely known as Quaid-e-Azam
        or Baba-e-Qoum which means the father of the nation.</q> <b>Quaid-e-Azam was born on the 25th of December in
        Karachi, in 1876.</b> Quaid-e-Azam was a successful lawyer as well as a politician.Quaid-e-Azam’s
        father’s name was Jinnah Poonja and his mother’s name was Mithibai.Quaid-e-Azam belonged to a rich
        merchant family. Quaid-e-Azam received his early education from Sindh Madrasa-ul-Islam and a Christian
        missionary school. He was sent to England at the mere age of 16 for higher education and later got admission to
        Lincoln’s Inn Law school to study Law. He returned home after studying abroad, then took over managing his
        family business.

        <i>A few years later, Quaid-e-Azam opened his law firm and became a successful lawyer and by 1900, he was
        appointed as a magistrate for the region’s presidency.</i> During this time, Jinnah noticed that Hindus and Muslims
        were united against England, but the Hindu leaders had set their interests somewhere else. Soon after this
        Quaid-e-Azam left behind practicing law and went on to join political parties so he could take up leadership
        positions among organizations that planned to form Pakistan’s identity. He started his political career with
        Indian National Congress in 1906, then after a time span of 7 years, Jinnah joined the Muslim League.

    <p><strong>Quaid-e-Azam</strong> was a man of his word and one of the greatest spokesmen. Mahatma Gandhi called Quaid-e-Azam “an
        impossible man” due to his determinacy over his principles. Jinnah always stood like a rock in front of his
        enemies and never backed down. In 1933, Jinnah became the leader of the Muslim League. In 1940, the Pakistan
        resolution was drafted by The Muslim League at Minar-e-Pakistan. After the Pakistan Resolution was passed,
        Quaid-e-Azam worked tirelessly day and night and did not care about his health at all, slowly his health started
        deteriorating but he never stopped working. It was due to Quaid-e-Azam’s tireless efforts that Pakistan came
        into being on the 1947, 14th of August. <em>Quaid-e-Azam passed away on the 11th of September in 1948.</em></p>
