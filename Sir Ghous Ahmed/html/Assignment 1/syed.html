    <h1>Syed</h1>
        <p><b>Sir Syed Ahmed Khan (October 17, 1817– 27 March 1898) was a teacher and politician.</b> He was a philospher as
            well. He was also a social reformer.<q> He founded the school that would later become Aligarh Muslim University.</q>
        </p>

        <p><i>In 1857 there was a rebellion in India. This is known as the First Indian War of Independence.</i> During this
            time,Sir Syed Ahmed Khan kept loyal to the British; He also saved many European lives. After the rebellion he
            wrote a book where he said the British were in fact those who caused the rebellion. In order to settle the question of
            whether Sir Syed was a communitarian or a communalist, we need to assess the speeches and articles which he
            wrote. One such speech of Sir Syed which he gave in Meerut in the year 1888 clearly shows that Sir Syed turned
            to arguments fielded by religious fanatics in order to develop a communal alliance between Indian Muslims and
            British Christians. He said,</p>
        
            <p><strong>Our Hindu brothers of these provinces are leaving us and are joining the Bengalis.</strong> Then we ought
            to unite with that nation with whom we can unite. No Mohammedan can say that the English are not “People of the Book” (Quranic
            term referring to Jews, Christians and Sabians). No Mohammedan can deny this: that God has said that no people
            of ‘other religions’ can be ‘friends’ of Mohammedans except ‘Christians’.<em>He who had read the Quran and
                believes it, he can know that our nation (Muslims) cannot expect friendship and affection from any other
                people.</em>At this time our nation is in a bad state as regards education and wealth, but God has given us the light of religion,
            and the Quran is present for our guidance, which has ordained them (Christians) and us (Muslims) to be friends.
