    <h1>Fatima</h1>
    
        <p><b>Fatima Jinnah (Urdu: فاطمہ جناح; 31 July 1893 – 9 July 1967) was a Pakistani politician, stateswoman and dental
            surgeon and one of the leading founders of Pakistan.</b><q> She was the younger sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the
            founding father and the first Governor General of Pakistan.</q>[1][2] She was the Leader of the Opposition of
            Pakistan from 1960 until her death in 1967.</p>
        
            <p>After obtaining a dental degree from the University of Calcutta in 1923, then she became the first female dentist
            of undivided India; she also became a close associate and an adviser to her older brother, Muhammad Ali Jinnah,
            who later became the first Governor General of Pakistan.<i> A strong critic of the British Raj, she emerged as a
            strong advocate of the two nation theory and a leading member of the All-India Muslim League.</i></p>
        
            <p><strong>After the independence of Pakistan, Jinnah co-founded the Pakistan Women's Association which played an integral
            role in the settlement of the women migrants in the newly formed country.</strong><em> She remained the closest confidant of
            her brother until his death.</em> After his death, Fatima was banned from addressing the nation until 1951; her 1951
            radio address to the nation was heavily censored by the Liaquat administration.[3] She wrote the book My
            Brother, in 1955 but it was only published 32 years later, in 1987, due to censorship by the establishment, who
            had accused Fatima of "anti-nationalist material." Even when published several pages from the book's manuscript
            were left out.[4]</p>
