    <h1 #top>Sorbet</h1>
    <p>Sorbet (/ˈsɔːrbeɪ, ˈsɔːrbət/, US also /sɔːrˈbeɪ/) is a frozen dessert made using ice combined with fruit
        juice, fruit purée, or other ingredients, such as wine, liqueur, or honey. Generally, sorbets do not contain
        dairy products, while sherbets do.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>It is believed that sorbets originated in ancient Persia as far back as 550–530 BCE.]</p>

    <p> There are a number of legendary origin myths, unsupported by any known evidence, that attribute the origins of
        sorbet to historical figures like the Roman Emperor Nero, Marco Polo and the Italian duchess Catherine de'
        Medici.</p>

    <p></p> Romans did not add ice to their drinks because easily accessible ice along the lower slopes of mountains was
    not
    sanitary for use in food preparation. Iced drinks were believed to cause convulsions, colic and a host of
    other ailments. Hippocrates was known to have criticized chilled drinks for causing "fluxes of the stomach",
    while Seneca lambasted the extravagant costs associated with iced desserts. Despite this, ice and snow were
    prized ingredients in ancient cuisines including Japanese, Chinese, Greek and Roman cuisines.</p>

    <p></p> The first Western mention of sherbet is an Italian reference to something that Turks drink. The word sherbet
    entered the Italian language as sorbetto, which later became sorbet in French. August Escoffier describes
    sorbet as "very light and barely-congealed ices, served after the Entrées. They serve in freshening the stomach;
    preparing it to properly receive the roast. They are appetizers and help to aid digestion". He recommends
    that they register 15° on the saccharometer and be of drinkable consistency.</p>

    <p> The first recipe in French for flavored ices appears in 1674, in Nicholas Lemery's Recueil de curiositéz rares
        et nouvelles de plus admirables effets de la nature. Recipes for sorbetti saw publication in the 1694
        edition of Antonio Latini's Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward). Recipes for flavored ices begin to
        appear in François Massialot's Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits, starting
        with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of
        his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow. When Europeans figured out how to freeze
        sherbet they began making sorbetto by adding fruit juices and flavorings to a frozen simple syrup base. In the
        US sherbet generally meant an ice milk, but recipes from early soda fountain manuals include ingredients such as
        gelatin, beaten egg whites, cream, or milk.</p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>Like granitas and other ices, sorbet can be made without an ice cream maker. Alcohol, honey or corn syrup can be
        added to lower the freezing point and make softer sorbets.</p>

    <p> Sorbet is usually made with fresh fruit and simple syrup, but other types of preparations exist. Tart sorbets
        are served as palate cleansers between savory courses of a meal. Mulled wine sorbet can be made with red
        wine, orange, lemons, mulling spices, ruby port, and egg whites. Muscat sorbet is made with dessert wine, lemon
        juice, and egg whites.</p>

    <p> Givré (French for "frosted") is the term for a sorbet served in a frozen coconut shell or hollowed-out fruit,
        such as a lemon. Agraz is a type of sorbet with an acidic flavor attributed by Larousse Gastronomique to the
        Maghreb region of North Africa. It is made from almonds, verjuice, and sugar.</p>
